# 🏞️ Allometry and size-selection in diatoms

To gain a quantitative perspective on the effects of [mixed layer dynamics](MixedLayers.md) on diatoms, Litchman *et al.* (2009) assumed that many diatom characteristics have allometries of the form of [power laws](./allometry.md),
```{math}
:label: L0
log_{10} X = log_{10}~a + (b \times s)
```
where $X$ is the trait of interest, $s$ is cell size, and $a$ and $b$ are allometric constants.
Taking the power of 10 of both sides,
```{math}
:label: L0a
X = a \times 10^{b \times s}
```
Litchman et al. analyzed data from the literature to obtain values of the allometric constants $a$ and $b$ for traits involved in growth, mortality and uptake and storage of nitrogen and phosphorus.
The separately analyzed diatoms from marine and freshwater environments.
Their results are summarized in their [supplemental materials](https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.0810891106/suppl_file/0810891106si.pdf).

## Model formulation

```{math}
:label: L1
\frac{dQ_i}{dt} = \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - V^{lo}_{max.i}  \right) \frac{Q_i-Q_{min,i}}{Q_{max,i}-Q_{min,i}} \right) \frac{R}{R+K_i} - \mu_i\left(1-\frac{Q_{min,i}}{Q_i} \right)
```

```{math}
:label: L2
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = \mu_i\left(1-\frac{Q_{min,i}}{Q_i} \right) N_i - m N_i - \frac{v_i}{z_m} N_i
```
```{math}
:label: L3
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \Sigma_i \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - V^{lo}_{max.i}  \right) \frac{Q_i-Q_{min,i}}{Q_{max,i}-Q_{min,i}} \right) \frac{R}{R+K_i} N_i
```

#  🛼 Evolutionarily Stable States for diatoms in mixed layers: Interpetation

In this part of the Activity, you will interpret the model results you tablulated in the [data collection phase](./DiatomESSActivity3.md).

This activity began with motivating questions focused on Litchman *et al.*'s analysis of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies of diatoms in mixed layers

> - Do Evolutionarily Stable States, as inferred from Litchman *et al.*'s model, correspond to relatively large diatom size distributions in marine environments?
> - Do long-term competitive outcomes from initially mixed populations match ESS outcomes?
> - Do diatom communities in mixed layers approach Evolutionarily Stable States or long-term competitive outcomes quickly enough to be observed in nature?

Because our implementation of their model makes it impractical to exhaustively test for ESS's among a large number of diatom size classes and a wide range in mixed layer characteristics, we instead examined a much smaller set of candidate ESS's suggested by the outcomes of competition among mixed diatom populations.

In Part 1, we started with the question,
> What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?  

We used the most successful competitors in a series of mixing intervals as candidates to test for ESS's in Part 2.

We also noted the approximate time scales over which dominant competitors excluded less successful competitors.
These timescales are important context for assessing how well we would expect steady state outcomes of competition and ESS's to be reflected in real-world mixing layers.

- Examine the tabulated observations of dominant diatom competitors and ESS's.
- Do you see evidence that mixed layer characteristics favor different size classes of diatoms?  
  In particular, Litchman *et al.*'s overall hypothesis is that temporal variations in mixing layer nutrient concentrations can lead to deviations from simple predictions that small diatoms are superior competitors.
  Do you see support for this hypothesis in your results?

In Part 2, we asked,
> Are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants also ESS's?
- Using mathematical approaches, it is in some cases easier and faster to determine ESS's than to compute long time series of competing populations.  
  In the limited dataset emerging from your mini-study, do ESS diatom variants appear to be good predictors of the dominant competitors in mixed diatom populations?
  
Finally, we asked,
> Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?  

ESS's give us no information about the timescales over which competitive exclusion occurs.

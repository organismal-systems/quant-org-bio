#  🛼 Evolutionarily Stable States for diatoms in mixed layers: Interpetation

In this part of the Activity, you will interpret the model results you tablulated in the [data collection phase](./DiatomESSActivity3.md).



> - Do Evolutionarily Stable States, as inferred from Litchman *et al.*'s model, correspond to relatively large diatom size distributions in marine environments?
> - Do long-term competitive outcomes from initially mixed populations match ESS outcomes?
> - Do diatom communities in mixed layers approach Evolutionarily Stable States or long-term competitive outcomes quickly enough to be observed in nature?



   > What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?  
   > Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?  
   > Are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants also ESS's?

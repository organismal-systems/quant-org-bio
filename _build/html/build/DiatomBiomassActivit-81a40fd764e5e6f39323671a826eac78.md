# 🛼 Size-dependence of diatom biovolume in mixed layers: Overview
Diatoms are a diverse group that represents a large fraction of [primary production](wiki:Primary_production) and oxygen generation in aquatic habitats worldwide.
Diatoms are also major prey species for aquatic grazers, important hosts for aquatic pathogens, and effective competitors for other primary producers.
The impacts diatom populations have, in these roles and others, are strongly affected  by the [standing stock](wiki:Population_density) of diatoms of different sizes.

[Litchman *et al.* (2009)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106) used data analysis and model results to support the hypothesis that *size-specific diatom standing stocks are strongly affected by the characteristics of the mixed layer in which they are growing*.
If true, this hypothesis raises the questions,
> - Does primary production increase or decrease with different mixed layer characteristics?  
> - Are diatoms more available to grazers and pathogens in some types of mixed layers than in others?
> - Do mixed layer characteristics affect the intensity of competition by diatoms for limiting nutrients?
> - In diverse populations, are the best competitors also the variants that maximize or minimize availability and competitive intensity?

In this Activity , you will use Litchman *et al.*'s model to conduct a "mini-study", in which you answer these questions within the assumptions and limitations of the model.

The outcome of the mini-study will be a set of plots, showing whether or not changes in mixing layer characteristics causes systematic variation of implied grazer, pathogen and competitor impacts.

These plots will suggest further hypotheses, with implications that could be tested with empirical studies, to assess whether the model's results reflect diatom populations in nature.

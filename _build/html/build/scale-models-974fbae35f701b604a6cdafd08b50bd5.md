# 📖 Scale models and dynamic similarity
Much of the discussion in this book involves [scale models](wiki:Scale_model).
Most of us are familiar with scale models, even if we don't ordimarily think of them using that name.
For example, a model boat that a child plays with in a bathtub is a scale model of a full sized boat that floats on the ocean. 
A doll is a scale model of a human being.
An architect often uses a scale model of a building to develop and explain a design. 
These examples are of large objects made small enough to be practical and inexpensive, but scale models that are enlargements of the original can also be useful. 
For example, a model of a microorganism or cell can be a useful tool for understanding its morphology and relationship with its surroundings. 

These examples reflect **geometric similarity**.
That is, the derived objects are scale models because their components have **geometries that are similar in proportion* to the originals**.

### Dynamic similarity
The concept of similarity can be extended to include forces acting on objects and their surroundings.
This concept is called ["dynamic similarity"](wiki:Similitude) or "similitude".
Scale models are dynamically similar if, in addition to being geometrically similar in proportion, *the different forces acting on them are also similar in proportion.*

The additional requirement of equal proportional forces means that not all geometrically similar scale models are dynamically similar. 
We all have an intuitive grasp of this fact.
To illustrate this, let's look at video of a scale model of the Titanic sailing on a body of water:

As you watch this video, consider your intuition about how big the model is.

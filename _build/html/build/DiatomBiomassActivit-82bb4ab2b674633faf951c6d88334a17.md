# 🛼 Size-dependence of diatom biovolume in mixed layers: Interpretation
In this part of the Activity, you will interpret the model results you tabulated in the [data collection phase](./DiatomBiomassActivity3.md).

Taking the motivating questions in turn:
> - Does primary production increase or decrease with different mixed layer characteristics?  
> - Are diatoms more available to grazers and pathogens in some types of mixed layers than in others?

These questions are related, in that both refer to diatom biovolume as a proxy, in one case for rate of primary production by the diatom population, and in the other for the "payoff" available to a grazer or pathogen attacking the diatom population.

- Examine the table and plot in Part 1 you made of biovolume as a function of diatom size class and mixing interval.  
- Do you see evidence in the model results that biovolume, and by implication availability and primary production, increase or decrease with mixing layer characteristics?
- Do you see evidence in the model results that trends in biovolume, and by implication availability and primary production, are different for different size classes of diatoms?
- Write a few sentences summarizing your conclusions and the interpretation of the model results that you use to arrive at them.
- What qualifications do you think should be attached to your conclusions, given the use of proxies, model assumptions and mini-study design?

> - Do mixed layer characteristics affect the intensity of competition by diatoms for limiting nutrients
This question refers to using mixed layer nutrient concentration as a proxy for competitive intensity with other primary producers (and among diatoms).

- Examine the table and plot you made in Part 1 of nutrient concentration as a function of diatom size class and mixing interval.  
- Do you see evidence in the model results that nutrient concentration, and by implication competitive impacts, increase or decrease with mixing layer characteristics?
- Do you see evidence in the model results that trends in nutrient concentration, and by implication competitive impacts, are different for different size classes of diatoms?
- Write a few sentences summarizing your conclusions and the interpretation of the model results that you use to arrive at them.
- What qualifications do you think should be attached to your conclusions, given the use of proxies, model assumptions and mini-study design?

> - In diverse diatom populations, are the best competitors also the variants that maximize or minimize availability and competitive intensity?

The data bearing on this question are model results that show the periodic population dynamics of monocultures of single diatom size classes ($s=2.5$, $s=6.79$, and $s=12.5$; and, the periodic dynamics of diverse populations diatoms ($s=2.5,3.93,5.36,6.79,8.21,9.64,11.1,12.5$
In the diverse population simulations, competition among variants determines which size classes are presents, rather than being set by initial conditions as in the monoculture simulations.

- Examine the table and plot you made in Part 2 of biovolume and nutrient concentration as a function mixing interval.  
- Do you see evidence in the model results that compenutrient concentration, and by implication competitive impacts, increase or decrease with mixing layer characteristics?
- Do you see evidence in the model results that trends in nutrient concentration, and by implication competitive impacts, are different for different size classes of diatoms?
- Write a few sentences summarizing your conclusions and the interpretation of the model results that you use to arrive at them.
- What qualifications do you think should be attached to your conclusions, given the use of proxies, model assumptions and mini-study design?

# 🛼 Evolutionarily Stable States for diatoms in mixed layers: Mini-study rationale
Your task in this Activity is to execute a "mini-study" that addresses the [motivating questions](./DiatomESSActivity.md) by tabulating [Evolutionarily Stable States](./EvolutionarilyStableStates.md), outcomes of competition among mixed diatom populations, and the timescales over which these outcomes occur, across several mixing intervals.
You will [interpret those data](./DiatomESSActivity4.md) results in terms of the motivating questions, in the next phase of the mini-study.

## Mini-study rationale
In their published research, Litchman *et al.* surveyed a finely resolved diatom size distribution, with numerous size classes.
They used a computerized loop to assess whether or not each of these size classes was an ESS, for each of a wide range of mixing intervals.
This approach is not practical in a mini-study.

Instead, you will execute your mini-study to address some elements of the motivating questions:
1. In **Part 1**, you will ask, 
   > What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?
   > Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?

In this part of the mini-study, you will conduct simulations to acquire two kinds of data:
1. You will tabulate the **number of cells**, to determine the "winning" variant under different mixing intervals, when an entire spectrum of diatom size variants is initially present.

	The rationale underlying this table is as an implementation of the principle of competitive exclusion:
In the long term, the "best" competitor should exlude all the other variants.

2. You will also record **how many days** are required for the diatom population to reach a "steady state" &ndash; that is, a constant period-averaged variant populations.

	The rationale underlying the second of these tables is an assessment of relevance to real-world settings, in which conditions change and multiple influences are exerted on diatom populations.
	In particular, if the predicted competitive outcomes occur only after many months or years, to what extent do we expect to see them in mixed layers in nature?

	If you find that diatom populations quickly approach these ESS or competitive outcomes, that would suggest these dynamics may dominate other factors in determining diatom size distributions. 
	Conversely, if you find that populations arrive at ESS and competitive outcomes only very slowly, that would suggest these dynamics may be overwhelmed by other factors in variable aquatic habitats.
   


2. In **Part 2**, you will ask,
   > Are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants also ESS's?

In this part of the mini-study, you will test whether the winning variants in Part 1 are ESS's.

There are two rationales for conducting these tests:
- Because [the outcomes of competition can differ from ESS's](./EvolutionarilyStableStates.md), the test for whether a variant (or combination of variants) is an ESS is different than a test for "winners" of competition among a mixed population.  

	Finding out whether "winners" of competitive outcomes are also ESS's is important in understanding the evolutionary implications of Litchman *et al.*'s model.
   If you find that "winners" of competition are also the variants that form EES's, that would support &ndash; at least for this subset of conditions &ndash; the relevance of the ESS concept as an indicator of trends in natural selection.
   Conversely, if you find that winners of competition in initially mixed populations differ from EES variants, that would suggest the specific assumptions underlying ESS analysis may be less relevant.

- Many population models are deceptively slow in arriving at "steady state", particularly when there are many similar competing variants.  
  
  Finding out whether the apparent winner is an ESS is a useful affirmation the the apparent steady state outcome is robust in the long term.

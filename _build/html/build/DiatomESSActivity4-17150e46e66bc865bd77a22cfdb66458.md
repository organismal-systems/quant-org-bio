#  🛼 Evolutionarily Stable States for diatoms in mixed layers: Interpetation

In this part of the Activity, you will interpret the model results you tablulated in the [data collection phase](./DiatomESSActivity3.md).

This activity began with motivating questions focused on Litchman *et al.*'s analysis of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies of diatoms in mixed layers

> - Do Evolutionarily Stable States, as inferred from Litchman *et al.*'s model, correspond to relatively large diatom size distributions in marine environments?
> - Do long-term competitive outcomes from initially mixed populations match ESS outcomes?
> - Do diatom communities in mixed layers approach Evolutionarily Stable States or long-term competitive outcomes quickly enough to be observed in nature?

Because our implementation of their model makes it impractical to exhaustively test for ESS's among a large number of diatom size classes and a wide range in mixed layer characteristics, we instead examined a much smaller set of candidate ESS's suggested by the outcomes of competition among mixed diatom populations.

In Part 1, we started with the question,
   > What are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants?  

We used the most successful competitors in a series of mixing intervals as candidates to test for ESS's in Part 2.

We also noted the time scales over which dominant competitors excluded less successful competitors.







> Over which time periods do the outcomes of competition among initially mixed diatom populations approach their final state?  
   > Are the outcomes of competition among initially mixed populations of diatom variants also ESS's?

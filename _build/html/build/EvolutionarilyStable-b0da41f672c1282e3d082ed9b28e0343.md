# 💡️ Evolutionarily Stable States: Predicting the outcomes of natural selection

An [Evolutionarily Stable State](wiki:Evolutionarily_stable_state), commonly abbreviated as an **ESS**, is description of the outcome of competition among a set of variants with different traits.
ESS's are related to the idea of [competitive exclusion](wiki:Competitive_exclusion_principle), the hypothesis that if two species, or variants of one species compete for the same limiting resource, one will be a better competitor and the other will die off[^better].

An ESS describes the scenario in which, if one variant (or combination of variants) is initially dominant, no other variants introduced in small numbers can grow.
That is, once established, an initial ESS population of variants can exclude "invasion" by a small number of individuals from any other variant.

For example, suppose a set of diatoms varying in size are competing for a limiting nutrient that is supplied at a constant rate.
Smaller diatoms have a faster growth rate at low nutrient concentrations than larger diatoms.
If the initial variant is a middle-sized diatom, it will draw the nutrients to the lowest concentration that allows it to grow.
If a few larger cells are then introduced, those cells cannot grow because their nutrient uptake is even worse at the nutrient level set by the established middle-sized cells.

However, if a few small cells are introduced, those cells can grow at the nutrient level established by the middle-sized cells.
As they grow, the small cells drive the nutrient levels even lower, until the middle-sized cells cannot grow and eventually die off. 
In this case, a population of middle-sized cells is not an ESS, because a population of middle-sized cells can be invaded by smaller cells.

In contrast, if the initial variant population is small, then the initial nutrient level is so low that neither middle-size nor large cells can invade.
In this case, the initial population of small cells is an ESS.

ESS populations are usually, but not always, the same as the outcome of competition among a small, mixed population of variants. 
Differences can arise due to the key assumption that *the initially dominant population creates the conditions into which other variants must invade*.

Because of this, different outcomes are possible.
For example, scenarios are possible in which two or more variants together form an ESS, excluding all other variants.
Scenarios are also possible in which multiple ESS's exist, for example variant A when established can exclude all other variants (including variant B), but variant B when established can also exclude all other variants (including variant A).

[^better]: Note that "better" in this context is defined as the successful competitor. For example, it could be that species A has faster uptake of high-concentration nutrients but species B has faster uptake of low-concentratin nutrients. If the nutrient is limiting, it will be driven down to low concentrations, so species B is "better" in competitive terms, even though under other circumstances species B might have higher growth. For example, under predation, both populations might be reduced so that nutrients are not limiting, and species B might predominate.

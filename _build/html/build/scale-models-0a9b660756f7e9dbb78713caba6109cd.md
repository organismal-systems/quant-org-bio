# 📖 Scale models and dynamic similarity
Much of the discussion in this book involves [scale models](wiki:Scale_model).
Most of us are familiar with scale models, even if we don't ordimarily think of them using that name.
For example, a model boat that a child plays with in a bathtub is a scale model of a full sized boat that floats on the ocean. 
A doll is a scale model of a human being.
An architect often uses a scale model of a building to develop and explain a design. 
These examples are of large objects made small enough to be practical and inexpensive, but scale models that are enlargements of the original can also be useful. 
For example, a model of a microorganism or cell can be a useful tool for understanding its morphology and relationship with its surroundings. 

These examples reflect **geometric similarity**.
That is, the derived objects are scale models because their components have **geometries that are similar in proportion* to the originals**.

### Dynamic similarity
The concept of similarity can be extended to include forces acting on objects and their surroundings.
This concept is called **dynamic similarity**.
Scale models are dynamically similar if, in addition to being geometrically similar in proportion, *the different forces acting on them are also similar in proportion.*

To understand this idea better, let's look at video of a scale model of the Titanic sailing on a body of water.
A convenient way to play this video from YouTube in a Jupyter notebook cell is shown in [this post](https://gist.github.com/christopherlovell/e3e70880c0b0ad666e7b5fe311320a62).

As you watch this video, consider your intuition about how big the model is.

# 💡️ Evolutionarily Stable States: Predicting the outcomes of natural selection

An [Evolutionarily Stable State](wiki:Evolutionarily_stable_state), commonly abbreviated as an **ESS**, is description of the outcome of competition among a set of variants with different traits.
ESS's are related to the idea of [competitive exclusion](wiki:Competitive_exclusion_principle), the hypothesis that if two species compete for the same limiting resource, one will be a better competitor and the other will die off[^better].
An ESS describes the scenario in which, if one variant (or combination of variants) is initially dominant, no other variants introduced in small numbers can grow.
That is, once established, a population of variants can exclude "invasion" by a small number of individuals from any other variant.

For example, suppose a set of diatoms varying in size are competing for a limiting nutrient, and that smaller diatoms have a faster growth rate at low nutrient concentrations than larger diatoms.
If the initial variant is a middle-sized diatom, it will draw the nutrients to the lowest concentration that allows it to grow.
If a few larger cells are then introduced, those cells cannot grow because their nutrient uptake is even worse at the nutrient level set by the established middle-sized cells.
However, if a few small cells are introduced, those cells can grow, because their minimum nutrient level 



[^better]: Note that "better" in this context is defined as the successful competitor. For example, it could be that species A has faster uptake of high-concentration nutrients but species B has faster uptake of low-concentratin nutrients. If the nutrient is limiting, it will be driven down to low concentrations, so species B is "better" in competitive terms, even though under other circumstances species B might have higher growth. For example, under predation, both populations might be reduced so that nutrients are not limiting, and species B might predominate.

# 🏞️ Why use models in Larval Biology?
Larval Biology is, historically, a mostly experimental disciplne. 
Larval Biologists have frequently pushed experimental technological boundaries.
Examples include confocal microscopy and other computerized imaging techniques; molecular techniques to identify taxa, measure population connectivity and understand patterns of development; and many other areas.
This innovative spirit has not reached similar levels in applying quantitative approaches like mathematical modeling and computer simulations to Larval Biology.
Mathematical models have so far made only modest contributions to Larval Biology, for example in Life History Evolution questions concerning the evolution of egg size.

The potential of mathematical tools to contribute to Larval Biology, however, is much broader and deeper than the current literature reflects.
One reason thinking about and using models can benefit Larval Biologists is that much of what we do already *implicitly* assumes some type of modeling framework.
For example, all statistics are based on underlying models about probability distributions and random processes that emerge from them (independent events, normal distributions, etc.).
Nearly all measurements of environmental characteristics (temperature, pH, salinity, etc.) are based on electrical measurements as proxies for the quantity being measured. 
The resistance or voltage measured is translated into the environmental quantity using models.
Even more broadly, most experimental design is based (often on an unspoken, intuitive level) on assumptions about how a measurement or manipulation carries implications for a biological process -- in other words, a model. 

A great many scientists who undertake statistical tests, use environmental sensors or design experiments have little awareness of the ways their work is based solidly on modeling.
Better awareness of the modeling already involved in their work, especially if they also approach their investigations with a quantitative framework in mind, could result in a very satisfying synergy:
Modelers who also undertake experiments can design more innovative and insightful models.
Experimentalists equipped with a modeling perspective can have insights that enable them to design better, more compelling experiments.
The best modeling of all is *modeling while experimenting*, when moving quickly between the computer and the laboratory or field site makes the connections between nature and models especially thought-provoking. 

Disseminating some of the background knowledge and experience for using models, and the understanding of why using models is a productive adjunct to traditional approaches in Larval Biology, is a primary objective of this book. 
A future Larval Biology in which the potential of models to enhance discovery is more fully exploited -- in which quantitative models are freely interdigitated among empirical methods and observations where each approach can best contribute  -- would be a more interesting, productive and impactful discipline.

Some of the reasons Larval Biologists might be interested in quantitative models are:

***Models are tools for inferring the logical consequences of specific assumptions.***

The emphasis here is on the "specific assumptions" as much as on the "logical consequences". 
In a career of modeling biological processes in which I believed I was well versed, and of helping other biologists to formulate models in their own areas of expertise, I have consistently encountered two phenomena:

- Formulating a mathematical model requires *specificity* in details that are easy to overlook in conceptual thinking\: 
Exactly *how* is a process like morphogenesis, synchronized spawning, predator avoidance or gene flow regulated? 
In what way are an egg, an early embryo, a larva and an adult "individuals" in a population model? 
I have been frequently flummoxed (and delighted) while modeling to discover basic aspects I had never thought about in organismal systems I thought I knew well.
Writing down a quantitative model, even if results are never calculated, exposes these details and the intriguing new insights and questions that arise from them.

- Different scientists, especially scientists from different disciplines, use the *same word with very different meanings*. 
This means that interdisciplinary collaborations, which are necessary and productive in Larval Biology, are frequently derailed by misunderstandings between two experts who have firm, well-founded (but different) interpretations of the subject at hand.
An example is "memory". 
To a mathematician or statistician, a "memoryless system" is one in which the current state determines the probabilities of future events, without regard to how the current state was brought about. 
Thus, a mathematician could happily formulate a "memoryless" model of the human brain.
Clearly, this would not be a biologist's interpretation.
Confounding vocabulary and other vagueness in terminology is usually clarified when the relevant biological mechanisms are expressed in mathematical form.


***Models are tools for inferring what we want to know from what we can measure.***

Larval Biology is frequently hampered by quantities and characteristics  that we want to know but cannot directly measure. 
What are the fitness implications of variants we observe in morphology, size, behavior, geography, or seasonality?
What are the mechanisms responsible for patterns in speciation and extinction, for species range expansion and contraction, or for the prevalence or rarity of different life history strategies? 
How is recruitment of a larval cohort limited or enhanced by each of the numerous biotic and abiotic environmental variables at a given time and place?
How are environmental signals transduced by sensory and regulatory processes into reproductive, foraging or mortality events?

All of these questions, and many more, involve unknowns that are difficult or impossible to measure.
Modeling provides approaches to infer quantities that cannot be measured. 
For example, it is in most cases impractical to measure the mortality rates of larvae in the plankton or in benthic environments. 
Direct measurements would involve unobtrusive observations following a large sample size of individual larvae, recording whether and how they died.
In most cases, this is not possible to carry out.
An alternative is to track cohorts of larvae, measuring changes in abundance, age- and stage- structure, and geographic distribution.
From cohort data, *combined with a modeling framework that provides quantitative predictions based on alternative mortality regimes*, inferences can be made regarding plausible rates and mechanisms of mortality in the observed larval population (e.g. [](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00443.x)).

Another way in which observations are constrained is in considering the consequences of hypothetical alternatives to observed characteristics such as morphology or life history.
Organisms that do not exist cannot be observed, but models that correctly reflect the key underlying mechanisms can give quantitative assessments of how those hypothetical organisms might function, in the context of changes in performance or distribution, evolutionary costs and benefits, etc.

***Models are tools for communicating biological knowledge across organisational levels.***

Another way in which models can contribute to insights in Larval Biology is by integrating specialized knowledge from different disciplines.
For example, biologists investigating maternal allocation to reproduction -- how many eggs of what size mom should make each year -- may focus on the physiology of egg production, the energy inputs and outputs of mature females, and coordination of spawning to maximize fertilization success.
However, they would not be able to draw inferences about the costs and benefits of the traits they observe without context: 
What are the functional consequences of smaller or larger larvae in terms of swimming ability, food capture and predator avoidance? 
What are the geographic implications of shorter or longer planktonic durations, and do those have implications for maintaining viable self-sustaining populations?
How do impacts in present environments compare to historical environments, or future environments affected by ocean change?

Each of these questions draws in the expertise of other scientists, whose understanding can be exploited by investigators of larval reproduction.
Biomechanical models may provide them with specific estimates of how swimming and sensory performance is likely to differ in smaller or larger larvae.
Demographic models may offer quantitative insight into the consequences of variations in planktonic duration.
Geophysical circulation models may predict the transport of larvae in tides and currents, and environmental characteristics such as temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll and pH that may affect larval recruitment.
Climate models may specify the environmental conditions in relevant to past and future environments.
In all these cases, quantitative models formulated at one biological or environmental level can be leveraged by investigators at another level.
Leveraging models in this way provides a mechanisms for community level collaborations, in which investigators make their discoveries available in the form of publicly available and easily used toolkits. 
This approach would mark a change for Larval Biology, but would be following the productive pathways of other disciplines such as statistics, geophysical modeling and molecular biology.

***Models let you make scientific discoveries anytime, anywhere.***

Beyond all of these reasons, one additional point which has given me satisfaction is worth mentioning: 
Most larvae are available only at narrowly constrained times and places, commonly a certain interval in spring or early summer, at a field station or offshore location. 
Experimental work in Larval Biology grinds to a halt outside this very limited window in space and time. 
Modeling is portable and extends the productive working season of a Larval Biologist to year-round.
A novel insight in Larval Biology, even if obtained on a computer rather than a microscope, is equally thrilling in the dark winter months!

# 📖️ Why are diatoms larger in marine than freshwater habitats?

[Allometry](wiki:Alometry) is the study of systematic variation of organismal traits across variations in size. 
Among aquatic[^aqu] organisms, size is associated with variations in numerous other traits and processes, including physiological traits such as respiration and nutrient uptake rates, organism-level traits such as intrinsic rate of growth and fecundity, behavioral traits such as locomotion and sensing, population-level traits such as reproduction and mortality rates, and ecological traits such as trophic interactions and carbon sequestration. 
Allometry is a useful tool for understanding linkages among aquatic organisms across organizational scales between these and many other traits.

[^aqu]: In Organismal Biology, the term *aquatic* is usually interpreted as referring to a water habitat that may be either marine (saltwater) or freshwater.

[Diatoms](wiki:Diatom) are a large group of single-celled algae inhabiting aquatic environments world-wide.
Diatoms are diverse &ndash; estimates of the number of species range as high as [200,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom#cite_note-29).

In 2009, [Litchman et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106) published a survey of diatom size distributions across a number of marine and freshwater environments.
They found that,

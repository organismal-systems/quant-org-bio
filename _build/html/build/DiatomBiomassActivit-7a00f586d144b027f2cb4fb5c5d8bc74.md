# 🛼 Size-dependence of diatom biomass in mixed layers

For comparability, we will use a standard set of diatom sizes for the basic model experiments (feel free to explore additional sizes if you want to):
\[ s=[2.5, 3.55, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25] \] and on four mixing intervals, \[ T=[3,14,35,40] \] 
For these parameter combinations:

 \textbf{Biomass of single variants:} Make sure only one variant is present (i.e., with Number of Phytoplankton Size Classes set to 1 at the top of the worksheet). Use different values of $s$ and $T$ to determine \textbf{what are the consequences for total biomass if diatom cells are of small or large sizes?} \textbf{What are the consequences of long vs. short mixing intervals for biovolumes of different-sized diatoms?} In your answers, use the information in the time series of quotas and nutrients to help interpret the patterns you observe in biovolume. \textit{Note that different dynamics are best visualized using different Plotting Intervals. For example, Plotting Interval [0,8] might best show initial transients well, [0,100] might best show longer transients, and [98,100] might best show details of long-term population cycles.}

# ️💡️  A "quota" model of diatom demography
Litchman *et al.*'s model of competing diatom variants uses the idea of nutrient "quotas" to understand the allometric differences between large and small diatoms in traits such as growth and nutrient consumption[^nut].
In their model, quotas represent nutrient storage within cells. 
When cell take up nutrients, they are placed directly into storage, increasing the cell's quota.
When the cell grows or divides, it consumes nutrients from its storage, decreasing its quota.

[^nut]: Litchman *et al.* modeled both nitrogen (nitrate) limitation and phosphorus limitation, but here we focus only on nitrogen.

Storage of nutrients has a consequence that is central to Litchman *et al.*'s hypothesis about the larger diatoms present in marine compared to freshwater habitats:
> Cell growth is determined not by the current nutrient concentration in the water, but by the nutrient quota that reflects past nutrient concentrations.

They hypothesized that  differences in quotas, quantified by the observed allometries in nutrient storage capacity and uptake rates, interact with the fluctuating conditions within mixed layers to favor larger diatoms in marine habitats and smaller diatoms in freshwater habitats.
Specifically, they hypothesized that, large diatoms with disproportionately large storage can continue growing under some conditions, when small diatoms have exhausted their quotas and ceased to grow.

## Model rationale

 

 
 
```{math}
:label: W1
\mathrm{change~in~quota} = \mathrm{nutrient~uptake~rate} - \mathrm{consumption~for~growth}
```

```{math}
:label: W2
\mathrm{change~in~cell~number} = \mathrm{growth} - \mathrm{mortality} - \mathrm{loss~from~sinking}
```
```{math}
:label: W3
\mathrm{change~in~nutrient~concentration} = -\mathrm{consumption~by~cells} + \mathrm{import~in~mixing~events}
```

The metric of size is $s = \log_{10}\mathrm{Cell~Volume} where Cell Volume is in $\mu m^3$.


- A cell's quota, $Q_i$, increases due to nutrient uptake and decreases when nutrient is used for growth.
- The rate at which nutrient uptake depends on nutrient concentration, $R$, is a Michaelis-Menton function, 
```{math}
:label: A1
\mathrm{nutrient~ uptake~rate} =  C_1 \frac{R}{R+K_i}
```
In words: When 
- In Equation [](#A1), the coefficient of proportionality $C_1$ for a cell of size $s_i$ is a linear function of the quota, $Q_i$, expressed relative to the cell's minimum quota, $Q_{min,i}$ and maximum quota, $Q_{max,i}$:
```{math}
:label: A2
C_1 = C_2 - C_3\frac{Q_i-Q_{min,i}}{Q_{max,i}-Q_{min,i}}
```
- In Equation [](#A2), the coefficients $C_2$ and $C_3$ are constants,
```{math}
:label: A3
C_2 = V^{hi}_{max.i} \\
C_3 = \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - V^{lo}_{max.i}  \right)
```
- In Equation {}(#A3), $C_2$ is the maximum rate of nutrient uptake, which occurs when the quota is low.
$C_3$ is the rate at which nutrient uptake decreases at higher quotas.
Because $C_2=C_3$ when the cell quota is $Q_i = Q_{max,i}$, the cell's nutrient uptake rate approaches zero as its quota approach its maximimum capacity, $Q_{max,i}$.
- Decrease in a cell's quota due to growth is 
```{math}
:label: A4
 \mathrm{consumption~for~growth} = \mu_i\left(1-\frac{Q_{min,i}}{Q_i} \right)
```



## Model formulation
 [ordinary differential equations](wiki:Ordinary_differential_equation)
 
 
```{math}
:label: L1
\frac{dQ_i}{dt} = \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - V^{lo}_{max.i}  \right) \frac{Q_i-Q_{min,i}}{Q_{max,i}-Q_{min,i}} \right) \frac{R}{R+K_i} - \mu_i\left(1-\frac{Q_{min,i}}{Q_i} \right)
```

```{math}
:label: L2
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = \mu_i\left(1-\frac{Q_{min,i}}{Q_i} \right) N_i - m N_i - \frac{v_i}{z_m} N_i
```
```{math}
:label: L3
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \sum_i \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - \left(V^{hi}_{max.i} - V^{lo}_{max.i}  \right) \frac{Q_i-Q_{min,i}}{Q_{max,i}-Q_{min,i}} \right) \frac{R}{R+K_i} N_i
```

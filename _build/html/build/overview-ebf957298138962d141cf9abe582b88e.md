# Preface

This is an [executable book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) presenting applications of quantitative reasoning to important questions in Organismal Biology research.
The book's purpose is to help students and professional scientists gain quantitative skills and perspectives enhancing their practice of Organismal Biology as a holistic, integrative field.

Organismal Biology, by its nature, operates at all the scales that organsism do. 
That is, it integrates across organisational scales from intracellular molecular reactions to ecosystem dynamics; spatial scales from nanometers to 1000s of kilometers, and temporal scales from microseconds to geologic eras.
At each of these diverse scales, the details of how organisms are constituted and how they function are fascinating and important. 
However, this diversity also requires Organismal Biologists to specialize in acquiring knowledge, skills and facilities for investigating in a small subset of fields relevant to their focal organisms.
They rely on other specialists to provide outside context for their observations and conclusions. 

Specialists with complementary expertise typically use different vocabulary, address different focal questions and work in different organisations.
For example, a simple term like "memory" has specific &ndash; but different &ndash; meanings to a behavioral ecologist, a mathematical biologist, a materials scientist and an immunologist.
How can these specialists collaborate efficiently and avoid misunderstanding if what one says is fundamentally different from what another hears?
The fragmentation of the biological sciences into subdisciplines that are mutually relevant but effectively isolated is among the biggest challenges currently facing Organismal Biology. 

One way to address this challenge is to use quantitative tools and executable models.
These tools and models can help integrate across scales and subdisciplines in several ways. 
First, because models and other quantitative analyses must define their terms explicitly and specifically, they enable any reader to understand precisely what is meant by a given term.

Second, models provide quantitative results that are effectively "take-home" summaries from in-depth studies in other subdisciplines. 
For example, a biologist investigating foraging behavior might exploit the results of a biomechanical study quantifying the cost of movement, without needing to replicate (or even understand) the basis of those results.
Likewise, the biomechanicist could use the results of a foraging model to assess the costs *vs.* benefits of alternative modes of locomotion.

## Absolute and relative measures of organisms
A third way quantitative tools and executable models can serve Organismal Biologists is by concisely summarizing which of the near-infinite number of potential connections, interactions and mechanisms are the most important in a given context.
For example, the energetic costs of locomotion can be much lower &ndash; relative to basal metabolism, reproduction and other demands &ndash; for a bacterium compared to a large terrestrial mammal or an insect such as a honeybee.
Conversely, the relative costs of modulating body temperature is typically moderate for a large terrestrial mammal, prohibitive for a smaller organism like a bacterium or bee, but moderate or negligible for an aggregation of small organisms such as a hive or compost heap.
An investigator of energetic constraints for each of these organisms could justifiably emphasize some mechanisms for expending energy while neglecting others.

But, how to know which mechanisms are primary and which are negligible?
The analysis of relative magnitudes of mechanisms is often referred to among biologists as "scaling", and among mathematicians as "dimensional analysis". 
The gist of this analytical approach is expressing organismal states and rates of change in relative instead of absolute terms.

For example, two organisms that each give birth to one offspring every week have, in one sense, the same birth rate &ndash; their absolute birth intervals are the same.
However, if one organism has a lifespan of three weeks and the other of six weeks, then the *effect* of that birth rate on population growth is quite different.
That is because birth interval and lifespan jointly determine population growth, and their *relative* magnitudes differ in the two organisms.

Suppose, instead, that one organism gives birth to one offspring every week and has a lifespan of three weeks, and the other gives birth every two weeks and has a lifespan of six weeks.
These organisms differ in their absolute birth intervals, but they are similar in a relative sense: the ratio of their birth intervals and lifespans are the same.
If we plot these populations using *time scaled by lifespan* on the horizontal axis, then the populations of these two organisms would follow exactly the same trajectories.

These organisms (and any other organism with the same birth interval/lifespan ratio) are referred to as being *dynamically similar* because they share the same relative magnitudes of key mechanisms (in this case, birth and death) and therefore their progression over time (scaled appropriately) are the same. That is, they are *scale models* of each other &mdash; understanding the dynamics of one also tells us the dynamics of the other.

### Nothing is big or small by itself
Measuring birth interval as a fraction of lifespan is just one example of thinking about metrics like "large", "small", "fast" and "slow" as relative comparisons between elements affecting organisms. 
That is, nothing is "big" or "small" by itself &ndash; a metric, state or rate characteristic of an organism are large or small only relative to other comparable metrics, states and rates.

More generally, it is typical for many factors to affect how an organism functions, but almost always only a subset of these factors have a significant effect in any given scenario. 
Exploiting scaling and dynamic similarity to identify hidden relationships and identify dominant *vs.* negligible mechanisms effecting organism function is an effective but underutilized approach in Organismal Biology. 
For instance, if in our example emigration occurs in addition to births and deaths, knowing that the emigration rate is much lower than the death rate we could justify neglecting emigration in a population model, while if it is on a par with the death rate then we know that it cannot be ignored.

Providing readers with opportunities to understand and practice this way of thinking about Organismal Biology, with an eye towards applying it in their own investigations, is a major theme in this book. 

## Models as aids to communication
Beyond making definitions and assumptions explicit, models also often offer opportunities to present results in visually appealing and easily understood ways.
Among the guidelines to contributors is encouragement to provide straightforward tools for generating and exporting graphical output that visualizes the key insights from their models about the causes and consequences of organismal characteristics.
Graphs of numerical results are a ubiquitous and powerful presentation mode.
Less common, but in many cases more compelling in conveying processes affecting organisms, are animations of dynamic processes (such as orientation of swimming organisms in turbulence, or spatial distributions of swimming larvae in tidally-driven estuaries), or variation of outcomes across parameter ranges (such as foraging success as a function of how patchy resources are).
Many sections in this book present activities in which readers are explicitly encouraged to practice generating constrasting graphical results, as the basis of presentations explaining key model dynamics and conclusions.

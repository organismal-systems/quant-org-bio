# 📖️ Allometry of growth, nutrient acquisition and storage in diatoms

Litchman *et al.* (2009) asked whether the characteristics of [mixed layers ](./MixedLayers.md) could explain the diversity and success of large diatoms, and their greater presence in marine habitats relative to freshwater habitats such as lakes.
They noted that the differences between typical marine and freshwater habitats are:
1. Mixed layers in marine habitats tend to be deeper than mixed layers in lakes.
2. Nitrogen (nitrate) is more often limiting for diatom growth in marine systems, while phosphorus is more often limiting for diatom growth in freshwater systems.

The significance of the first point is that losses due to cells sinking out of the mixed layer due to their own [sinking velocities](../../../subrepos/biomechanics/ReSphere/RS1.ipynb) are lower when mixed layers are deeper.
Cell losses due to sinking may be higher for larger diatom cells than for smaller cells[^sink].
If so, higher losses from shallow mixed layers might favor small, rarely lost cells over larger, more frequently lost cells.
Because mixed layers tend to be shallower in lakes, this could impact freshwater diatoms more than marine diatoms.

[^sink]: This is likely dependent on the condition of the diatom: healthy cells may be able to regulate their densities to prevent sinking, while starved cells may not.

The significance of the second point is that diatom cells can store key nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus.
However, because they are stored within different parts of cells, diatoms' storage capacities have different allometries for nitrogen than for phosphorus.
Larger diatoms have disproportionately higher storage capacity (relative to requirements for growth) for nitrogen than smaller cells.
However, storage capacity (relative to requirements for growth) for phosphorus are more nearly proportional in large and small diatom cells.
If so, potential advantages from greater storage capacity are more likely to favor larger cells in nitrogen-limited marine habitats than in phosphorus limited freshwater habitats.

With this in mind, Litchman et al. then asked, 

> Do characteristics of some mixed layers confer advantages to cells with higher storage capacities, and if so are those characteristics more prevalent in marine than freshwater habitats?

The model they used to investigate this question is outlined in [the next section](Litchman_etal2009.md).

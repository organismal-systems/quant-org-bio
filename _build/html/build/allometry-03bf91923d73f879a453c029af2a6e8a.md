# 🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size

One area in which Organismal Biologists use these ideas is in the study of [allometry](wiki:Allometry).
Allometry is the study of how organismal traits such as mass, morphology of limbs and other structures, locomotion and other behaviors, and physiological characteristics such as respiration and nutrient uptake vary systematically with body length or similar metrics of size.

Allometric relationships within taxonomic groups are usually determined by statistical analysis of observations across a range of organism sizes within the group.
These observations are most commonly plotted on log-log plots, and statistically analyzed to detect

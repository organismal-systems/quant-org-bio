# 📖️ Why are diatoms larger in marine than freshwater habitats?

[Allometry](wiki:Alometry) is the study of systematic variation of organismal traits across variations in size. 
Among aquatic organisms[^aqu], size is associated with numerous effects on 

[^aqu]: In Organismal Biology, the term *aquatic* is usually interpreted as referring to a water habitat that may be either marine (saltwater) or freshwater.

In 2009, [Litchman et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106) published a survey of diatom size distributions across a number of marine and freshwater environments.

A placeholder for a page showing observations from Litchman et al. (2009) showing that marine diatom size distributions are larger than freshwater diatoms.

Describes mixed layers and deep-water mixing events in both environments, and poses their hypothesis for environmental differences.

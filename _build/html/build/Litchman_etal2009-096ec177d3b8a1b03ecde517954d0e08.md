# 🏞️ Allometry and size-selection in diatoms

To gain a quantitative perspective on the effects of [mixed layer dynamics](MixedLayers.md) on diatoms, Litchman *et al.* (2009) assumed that many diatom characteristics have allometries of the form of [power laws](./allometry.md),
```{math}
:label: L0
log_{10} X = log_{10}~a + (b \times s)
```
where $X$ is the trait of interest, $s$ is cell size, and $a$ and $b$ are allometric constants.
Taking the power of 10 of both sides,
```{math}
:label: L0a
X = a \times 10^{b \times s}
```
Litchman et al. analyzed data from the literature to obtain values of the allometric constants $a$ and $b$ for traits involved in growth, mortality and uptake and storage of nitrogen and phosphorus.
The separately analyzed diatoms from marine and freshwater environments.
Their results are summarized in their [supplemental materials](https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.0810891106/suppl_file/0810891106si.pdf).

## Model formulation
Litchman *et al.* formulated a model that tracks the increase and decrease of diatom populations in a [mixed layer](./MixedLayers.md).
At intervals, a mixing event such as a storm occurs.
A mixing event replaces a fraction of the water in the mixed layer with an equal amount of water from below the mixed layer.
The diatoms in the displaced mixed layer water are lost, decreasing the cell populations in the mixed layer.
However, the deep water entering the mixed layer brings new nitrogen, which can fuel enhanced diatom growth.

# 💡️ Evolutionarily Stable States: Predicting the outcomes of natural selection

An [Evolutionarily Stable State](wiki:Evolutionarily_stable_state), commonly abbreviated as an **ESS**, is description of the outcome of competition among a set of variants with different traits.
An ESS describes the scenario in which, if one variant is initially dominant, no other variant can grow if introduced in small numbers.


ESS's are related to the idea of [competitive exclusion](wiki:Competitive_exclusion_principle), the hypothesis that if two species compete for the same limiting resource, one will be a better competitor and the other will die off[^better].


[^better]: Note that "better" in this context is defined as the successful competitor. For example, it could be that species A has faster uptake of high-concentration nutrients but species B has faster uptake of low-concentratin nutrients. If the nutrient is limiting, it will be driven down to low concentrations, so species B is "better" in competitive terms, even though under other circumstances species B might have higher growth. For example, under predation, both populations might be reduced so that nutrients are not limiting, and species B might predominate.

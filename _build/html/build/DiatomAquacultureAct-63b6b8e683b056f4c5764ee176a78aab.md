# 🛼 Implications of allometry for diatom aquaculture

For comparability, we will use a standard set of diatom sizes for the basic model experiments (feel free to explore additional sizes if you want to):
\[ s=[2.5, 3.55, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25] \] and on four mixing intervals, \[ T=[3,14,35,40] \] 
For these parameter combinations:

 \textbf{Biomass of single variants:} Make sure only one variant is present (i.e., with Number of Phytoplankton Size Classes set to 1 at the top of the worksheet). Use different values of $s$ and $T$ to determine \textbf{what are the consequences for total biomass if diatom cells are of small or large sizes?} \textbf{What are the consequences of long vs. short mixing intervals for biovolumes of different-sized diatoms?} In your answers, use the information in the time series of quotas and nutrients to help interpret the patterns you observe in biovolume. \textit{Note that different dynamics are best visualized using different Plotting Intervals. For example, Plotting Interval [0,8] might best show initial transients well, [0,100] might best show longer transients, and [98,100] might best show details of long-term population cycles.}

 \textbf{Evolutionary stable strategies:} A key idea in evolutionary analysis is the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (a.k.a. Evolutionar\underline{ily} Stable Strategy), or \textit{ESS}. An \textit{ESS} among a range of variants (in this case, diatoms of different sizes), is a variant that once established cannot be invaded by any other variant. For example, suppose a population of variant $s_1$ is established in the mixed layer. Variant $s_1$ is an \textit{ESS} if an initially small population of any other size variant $s_2$ would decrease (due to competition from $s_1$ diatoms). If at least one variant $s_2$ can increase from an initially small population, then $s_1$ is not an \textit{ESS}.

There may or may not be an \textit{ESS} in any particular trait-based model. In some cases, no single variant is an \textit{ESS} but a combination of two variants might jointly form an \textit{ESS}. That is, $s_1$ and $s_2$ form a joint \textit{ESS} if established coexisting populations of $s_1$ and $s_2$ variants can exclude any distinct $s_3$ variant (more preciesely, if an initially small population of $s_3$ variants decreases over time). 

To investigate competition, coexistence and \textit{ESS}'s across a range of diatom sizes, we will look at dynamics when multiple variants are present simultaneously. \textbf{Set the Number of Phytoplankton Size Classes at the top of the worksheet to 8 (remember to re-execute the evaluation group!).} The worksheet will create a default range of variants in $s$. Examine the outcome of 8-way competition for each of the focal mixing intervals $T$. What sized diatoms appear to be the best competitors under different mixing intervals? Is there an indication of $ESS$ diatom sizes under the assumed fluctuating resources and allometric uptake and storage relationships? Are variants that maximize biomass the same as variants that form \textit{ESS}'s (and if not, which would you expect to see in the plankton)? 

 \textbf{ Aquaculture:} If you were to use diatoms in a biofuels or aquaculture setting\footnote{In reality, other phytoplankton types would probably be preferable, but the design criteria and rationale might be very similar across taxa.}, you might design a chemostat or closed pond system that functions much like the mixed layer in Litchman et al.'s model: periodically you might extract water containing phytoplankton and replace it with nutrient-enriched water. Based on your answer above, \textbf{which combinations of diatom size and mixing interval would you choose to make maximize productivity?}

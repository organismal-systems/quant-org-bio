# Biomechanics in physiology, behavior and sensing
This section focuses on perspectives on Organismal Biology relating to biomechanic.
The units in this section address questions that can be broadly framed as:
> - How are  biomechanical consequences of organisms' morphology, movement, habitat selection and other traits reflected in their performance of key functions?
> - How are do functional requirements impose biomechanical constraints on organisms?

The traits of interest span the diverse attributes of organisms: physiological, behavioral, sensory, and many other characteristics.
The case studies and activities elucidate linkages between these organismal attributes and their impacts on both higher and lower levels of organisation, as mediated by biomechanics.

The units in the section currently are:
- [Understanding and predicting the movement of particles in fluids](../../subrepos/biomechanics/ReSphere/README.md), with application to relevant biotic particles (eggs, pollen, *etc.*) and abiotic particles (fecal pellets, iron-containing dust, *etc.*).

- [A model of swimming and orientation of early-stage marine invertebrate larvae](../../subrepos/biomechanics/ChimeraSwim/ChimeraSwim.md) which simulates biomechanical consequences of embryo size and morphology.

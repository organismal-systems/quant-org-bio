# 📖️ Why are diatoms larger in marine than freshwater habitats?

[Allometry](wiki:Allometry) is the study of systematic variation of organismal traits across variations in size. 
Among aquatic[^aqu] organisms, size is associated with variations in numerous other traits and processes, including physiological traits such as respiration and nutrient uptake rates, organism-level traits such as intrinsic rate of growth and fecundity, behavioral traits such as locomotion and sensing, population-level traits such as reproduction and mortality rates, and ecological traits such as trophic interactions and carbon sequestration. 
Allometry is a useful tool for understanding linkages among aquatic organisms across organizational scales between these and many other traits.

[^aqu]: In Organismal Biology, the term *aquatic* is usually interpreted as referring to a water habitat that may be either marine (saltwater) or freshwater.

[Diatoms](wiki:Diatom) are a large group of single-celled algae inhabiting aquatic environments world-wide.
Diatoms are diverse, with about 12,000 known species[^abu].
Across this diversity, diatoms encompass a wide range of sizes ($2-2000 \mu m$), and morphologies with numerous beautiful and interesting features [](frustule).

[^abu]: Estimates of the number of species ranging from 20,000 to as high as 200,000.


Diatoms are also abundant, and are estimated to produce 20-50% of new oxygen generated worldwide each year.
Diatoms are major contributors to primary production, are important consumers of dissolved nutrients and have strong trophic interactions with zooplankton grazers, heterotrophic protists and aquatic pathogens.

Diatoms are encased in hard silica shells called [frustules](wiki:Frustule).

Due in part to the weigh of these frustules, diatom cells can sink rapidly.
This makes diatoms significant contributors to sequestration into deep water of carbon fixed by photosynthesis in surface layers.

In 2009, [Litchman et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0810891106) published a survey of diatom size distributions across a number of marine and freshwater habitats.
They found that, though there is a large diversity of sizes in all habitats, the size distribution in marine habitats is consistently larger than the size distribution in freshwater habitats.

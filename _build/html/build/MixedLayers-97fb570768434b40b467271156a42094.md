# 📖️  Mixed layers
Most aquatic environments are vertically stratified some or all the time, meaning that there is vertical variation in water properties such as temperature and salinity.
Typically, surface waters tend (at least seasonally) to be higher temperature (e.g., because they are warmed by the sun or warm air) and/or lower salinity than deeper waters.
This variation, known as *stable stratification*, means that the water in surface layers is less dense than water in deeper layers.

In the absence of a mechanism to energetically stir water in a stably stratified water column, near-surface water will remain near-surface, and deep water will remain deep, indefinitely.
The primary stirring mechanism in most oceanic and lake environments is wind, which causes waves, currents and tubulence in surface waters.
Stirring from wind typically overcomes stratification near the surface.
However, it usually penetrates only partway into a water column.

Within this near-surface zone of penetration, wind-induced turbulence mixes water so that temperature and salinity are relatively uniform. 
This zone is called the [mixed layer](wiki:Mixed_layer).
Within the mixed layer, stratification has been lost, so that cells or nutrients at one level within the mixed layer can easily be transported to another level within the layer.

However, there remains a density difference between water in the mixed layer and deeper water.
That means it takes substantial extra energy to mix lighter mixed layer water with denser water from below the mixed layer.
This extra energy is supplied episodically by events such as storms and internal waves.

Like phytoplankton in general, diatoms typically inhabit the mixed_layer) within aquatic environments.
As these cells grow and reproduce, they consume nutrients.
Once nutrients are depleted, they can be replaced only by mixing events that replace some of the nutrient-depleted surface water with nutrient-rich deep water.
Concurrently, some near-surface water is moved deeper, below the mixed layer.
Diatoms and other phytoplankton cells in that water are then typically lost into deep water, where they are unable to photosynthesize and eventually die or are eaten.


Litchman *et al.* noted that among the differences between typical marine and freshwater habitats are:
1. Mixed layers in marine habitats tend to be deeper than mixed layers in lakes.
2. Nitrogen (nitrate) is more often limiting for diatom growth in marine systems, while phosphorus is more often limiting for diatom growth in freshwater systems.

The significance of the first point is that losses due to cells being lost from the mixed layer due to their own sinking velocities are lower when mixed layers are deeper.
Cell losses due to sinking may be higher for larger diatom cells than for smaller cells[^sink].
If so, higher losses from shallow mixed layers might favor small, rarely lost cells over larger, more frequently lost cells.

[^sink]: This is likely dependent on the condition of the diatom: healthy cells may be able to regulate their densities to prevent sinking, while starved cells may not.

The significance of the second point is that diatom cells can store key nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus.
However, because they are stored within different parts of cells, diatoms' storage capacities have different allometries for nitrogen than for phosphorus.
Larger diatoms have disproportionately higher storage capacity than smaller cells.



Of course, that means some of the surface water was mi

However that mixing occurs only within that near-surface zone.

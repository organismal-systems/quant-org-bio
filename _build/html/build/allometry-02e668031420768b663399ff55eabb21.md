# 🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size

One area in which Organismal Biologists use these ideas is in the study of [allometry](wiki:Allometry).
Allometry is the study of how organismal traits vary systematically with body length or similar metrics of size.
Allometric relationships have been found or hypothesized for many traits, including mass, morphology of limbs and other structures, locomotion and other behaviors, and physiological characteristics such as respiration and nutrient uptake.

A well-known example of an allometric relationshop is [Kleiber's law](wiki:Kleiber's_law), which posits that the basal metabolic rate of animals varies approximately as the animal's mass raised to the $\frac{3}{4}$ power:

Allometric relationships within taxonomic groups are usually determined by statistical analysis of observations across a range of organism sizes within the group.
These observations are most commonly plotted on log-log plots, and statistically analyzed to detect trends.
A line on a log-log plot represents a power law relationship, which can be expressed mathematically as 
$$
trait = sise^p,
$$
where $t$ is the trait under consideration, $s$ is a metric of size, and $p$ is an exponent indicating the type of allometry.
For example, in [](kleiber), 
$$
 = s^p,
$$

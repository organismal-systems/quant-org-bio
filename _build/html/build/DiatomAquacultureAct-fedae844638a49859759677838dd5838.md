# 🛼 Implications of allometry for diatom aquaculture

For comparability, we will use a standard set of diatom sizes for the basic model experiments (feel free to explore additional sizes if you want to):
\[ s=[2.5, 3.55, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25] \] and on four mixing intervals, \[ T=[3,14,35,40] \] 
For these parameter combinations:


 \textbf{ Aquaculture:} If you were to use diatoms in a biofuels or aquaculture setting\footnote{In reality, other phytoplankton types would probably be preferable, but the design criteria and rationale might be very similar across taxa.}, you might design a chemostat or closed pond system that functions much like the mixed layer in Litchman et al.'s model: periodically you might extract water containing phytoplankton and replace it with nutrient-enriched water. Based on your answer above, \textbf{which combinations of diatom size and mixing interval would you choose to make maximize productivity?}

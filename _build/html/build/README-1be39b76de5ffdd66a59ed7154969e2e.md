# Demography, epidemeology and other dyamics of populations
This section focuses on population-level perspectives on Organismal Biology.
The units in this section address questions that can be broadly framed as:
> - How are organismal traits reflected in the dynamics of populations and their consumers, predators, prey and pathogens?
> - How do the dynamics of populations and their consumers, predators, prey and pathogens shape organismal traits?

The traits of interest span the diverse attributes of organisms: physiological, behavioral, life history, and many other characteristics.
The case studies elucidate linkages between these organismal attributes and their impacts on both higher and lower levels of organisation, as mediated by populations.

Case studies in the section currently are:
- [Exploration of cloning](../../subrepos/demography/LarvalCloning/LarvalCloning.md) in marine invertebrate larvae as a little-studied alternative to conventional larval life histories.

- [A model of diatom population dynamics and evolution](../../subrepos/demography/DiatomSizeESS/MarineFreshDiatoms.md) which simulates demographic and evolutionary consequences of allometries in growth and nutrient uptake.

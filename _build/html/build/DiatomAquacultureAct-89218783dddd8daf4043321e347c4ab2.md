# 🛼 Implications of allometry for diatom aquaculture and carbon sequestration

## Aquaculture

The point of this activity is to assess biomass extraction in an aquaculture setting, analogous to a mixing event.



The metric is biovolume removed in a mixing event, plus biovolume lost by sinking

Need a way to record mixing event losses and sinking losses.

The tasks:

Motivating questions:
- What variants, mixing fraction and mixing intervals maximize biovolume extraction?

Will this always be the smallest cells, most frequent extractions, and whatever interval maximizes extraction? Is there allometry in the payoff per biovolume (and can it be easily implemented)?


For comparability, we will use a standard set of diatom sizes for the basic model experiments (feel free to explore additional sizes if you want to):
\[ s=[2.5, 3.55, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25] \] and on four mixing intervals, \[ T=[3,14,35,40] \] 
For these parameter combinations:


 \textbf{ Aquaculture:} If you were to use diatoms in a biofuels or aquaculture setting\footnote{In reality, other phytoplankton types would probably be preferable, but the design criteria and rationale might be very similar across taxa.}, you might design a chemostat or closed pond system that functions much like the mixed layer in Litchman et al.'s model: periodically you might extract water containing phytoplankton and replace it with nutrient-enriched water. Based on your answer above, \textbf{which combinations of diatom size and mixing interval would you choose to make maximize productivity?}

## Carbon export from the mixed layer
This is related to carbon export to deep water through mixing events and sinking

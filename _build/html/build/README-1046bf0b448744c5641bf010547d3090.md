# Demography, epidemeology and other dyamics of populations
This section focuses on population-level perspectives on Organismal Biology.
The units in this section address questions that can be broadly framed as:
> - How are organismal traits reflected in the dynamics of populations and their consumers, predators, prey and pathogens?
> - How do the dynamics of populations and their consumers, predators, prey and pathogens shape organismal traits?

The traits of interest span the diverse attributes of organisms: physiological, behavioral, life history, and many other characteristics.

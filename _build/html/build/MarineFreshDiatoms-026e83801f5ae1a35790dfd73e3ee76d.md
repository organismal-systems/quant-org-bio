# 📖️ Why are diatoms larger in marine than freshwater habitats?

A placeholder for a page showing observations from Litchman et al. (2009) showing that marine diatom size distributions are larger than freshwater diatoms.

Describes mixed layers and deep-water mixing events in both environments, and poses their hypothesis for environmental differences.

This is the [allometry](../../../content/overview/allometry.md) page.

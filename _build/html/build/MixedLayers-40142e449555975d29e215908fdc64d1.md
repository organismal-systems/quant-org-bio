# 📖️  Mixed layers
Most aquatic environments are vertically stratified some or all the time, meaning that there is vertical variation in water properties such as temperature and salinity.
Typically, surface waters tend (at least seasonally) to be higher temperature (e.g., because they are warmed by the sun or warm air) and/or lower salinity than deeper waters.
This variation, known as *stable stratification*, means that the water in surface layers is less dense than water in deeper layers.

In the absence of a mechanism to energetically stir water in a stably stratified water column, near-surface water will remain near-surface, and deep water will remain deep, indefinitely.
The primary stirring mechanism in most oceanic and lake environments is wind, which causes waves, currents and tubulence in surface waters.
Stirring from wind typically overcomes stratification near the surface.
However, it usually penetrates only partway into a water column.

Within this near-surface zone of penetration, wind-induced turbulence mixes water so that temperature and salinity are relatively uniform. 
This zone is called the [mixed layer](wiki:Mixed_layer).
Within the mixed layer, stratification has been lost, so that cells or nutrients at one level within the mixed layer can easily be transported to another level within the layer.

However, there remains a density difference between water in the mixed layer and deeper water.
That means it takes substantial extra energy to mix lighter mixed layer water with denser water from below the mixed layer.
This extra energy is supplied episodically by events such as storms and internal waves.

Like phytoplankton in general, diatoms typically inhabit the mixed_layer) within aquatic environments.
As these cells grow and reproduce, they consume nutrients.
Once nutrients are depleted, they can be replaced only by mixing events that replace some of the nutrient-depleted surface water with nutrient-rich deep water.
Concurrently, some near-surface water is moved deeper, below the mixed layer.
Diatoms and other phytoplankton cells in that water are then typically lost into deep water, where they are unable to photosynthesize and eventually die or are eaten.

\n\nexecutable book presenting applications of quantitative reasoning to important questions in Organismal Biology research.\nThe book’s purpose is to help students and professional scientists gain quantitative skills and perspectives enhancing their practice of Organismal Biology as a holistic, integrative field.\n\nOrganismal Biology, by its nature, operates at all the scales that organsism do.\nThat is, it integrates across organisational scales from intracellular molecular reactions to ecosystem dynamics; spatial scales from nanometers to 1000s of kilometers, and temporal scales from microseconds to geologic eras.\nAt each of these diverse scales, the details of how organisms are constituted and how they function are fascinating and important.\nHowever, this diversity also requires Organismal Biologists to specialize in acquiring knowledge, skills and facilities for investigating in a small subset of fields relevant to their focal organisms.\nThey rely on other specialists to provide outside context for their observations and conclusions.\n\nSpecialists with complementary expertise typically use different vocabulary, address different focal questions and work in different organisations.\nFor example, a simple term like “memory” has specific – but different – meanings to a behavioral ecologist, a mathematical biologist, a materials scientist and an immunologist.\nHow can these specialists collaborate efficiently and avoid misunderstanding if what one says is fundamentally different from what another hears?\nThe fragmentation of the biological sciences into subdisciplines that are mutually relevant but effectively isolated is among the biggest challenges currently facing Organismal Biology.\n\nOne way to address this challenge is to use quantitative tools and executable models.\nThese tools and models can help integrate across scales and subdisciplines in several ways.\nFirst, because models and other quantitative analyses must define their terms explicitly and specifically, they enable any reader to understand precisely what is meant by a given term.\n\nSecond, models provide quantitative results that are effectively “take-home” summaries from in-depth studies in other subdisciplines.\nFor example, a biologist investigating foraging behavior might exploit the results of a biomechanical study quantifying the cost of movement, without needing to replicate (or even understand) the basis of those results.\nLikewise, the biomechanicist could use the results of a foraging model to assess the costs vs. benefits of alternative modes of locomotion.","type":"content","url":"/overview","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preface","lvl2":"Absolute and relative measures of organisms"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/overview#absolute-and-relative-measures-of-organisms","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preface","lvl2":"Absolute and relative measures of organisms"},"content":"A third way quantitative tools and executable models can serve Organismal Biologists is by concisely summarizing which of the near-infinite number of potential connections, interactions and mechanisms are the most important in a given context.\nFor example, the energetic costs of locomotion can be much lower – relative to basal metabolism, reproduction and other demands – for a bacterium compared to a large terrestrial mammal or an insect such as a honeybee.\nConversely, the relative costs of modulating body temperature is typically moderate for a large terrestrial mammal, prohibitive for a smaller organism like a bacterium or bee, but moderate or negligible for an aggregation of small organisms such as a hive or compost heap.\nAn investigator of energetic constraints for each of these organisms could justifiably emphasize some mechanisms for expending energy while neglecting others.\n\nBut, how to know which mechanisms are primary and which are negligible?\nThe analysis of relative magnitudes of mechanisms is often referred to among biologists as “scaling”, and among mathematicians as “dimensional analysis”.\nThe gist of this analytical approach is expressing organismal states and rates of change in relative instead of absolute terms.\n\nFor example, two organisms that each give birth to one offspring every week have, in one sense, the same birth rate – their absolute birth intervals are the same.\nHowever, if one organism has a lifespan of three weeks and the other of six weeks, then the effect of that birth rate on population growth is quite different.\nThat is because birth interval and lifespan jointly determine population growth, and their relative magnitudes differ in the two organisms.\n\nSuppose, instead, that one organism gives birth to one offspring every week and has a lifespan of three weeks, and the other gives birth every two weeks and has a lifespan of six weeks.\nThese organisms differ in their absolute birth intervals, but they are similar in a relative sense: the ratio of their birth intervals and lifespans are the same.\nIf we plot these populations using time scaled by lifespan on the horizontal axis, then the populations of these two organisms would follow exactly the same trajectories.\n\nThese organisms (and any other organism with the same birth interval/lifespan ratio) are referred to as being dynamically similar because they share the same relative magnitudes of key mechanisms (in this case, birth and death) and therefore their progression over time (scaled appropriately) are the same.\nThat is, they are scale models of each other — understanding the dynamics of one also tells us about the dynamics of the other.\nFor example, it has been argued that, in terms of foraging, \n\nbacteria are scale models of gazelles!","type":"content","url":"/overview#absolute-and-relative-measures-of-organisms","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preface","lvl3":"Nothing is big or small by itself","lvl2":"Absolute and

itself","lvl2":"Absolute and relative measures of organisms"},"content":"Measuring birth interval as a fraction of lifespan is just one example of thinking about metrics like “large”, “small”, “fast” and “slow” as relative comparisons between elements affecting organisms.\nThat is, nothing is “big” or “small” by itself – a metric, state or rate characteristic of an organism is large or small only relative to other comparable metrics, states and rates.\n\nMore generally, it is typical for many factors to affect how an organism functions, but almost always only a subset of these factors have a significant effect in any given scenario.\nExploiting scaling and dynamic similarity to identify hidden relationships and identify dominant vs. negligible mechanisms affecting organism function is an effective but underutilized approach in Organismal Biology.\nFor instance, if in our example emigration occurs in addition to births and deaths, knowing that the emigration rate is much lower than the death rate we could justify neglecting emigration in a population model, while if it is on a par with the death rate then we know that it cannot be ignored.\n\nProviding readers with opportunities to understand and practice this way of thinking about Organismal Biology, with an eye towards applying it in their own investigations, is a major theme in this book.","type":"content","url":"/overview#nothing-is-big-or-small-by-itself","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preface","lvl2":"Models as aids to

animations of dynamic processes (such as orientation of swimming organisms in turbulence, or spatial distributions of swimming larvae in tidally-driven estuaries), or variation of outcomes across parameter ranges (such as foraging success as a function of how patchy resources are).\nMany sections in this book present activities in which readers are explicitly encouraged to practice generating

ideas is in the study of \n\nallometry.\nAllometry is the study of how organismal traits vary systematically with body length or similar metrics of size.\nAllometric relationships have been found or hypothesized for many traits, including mass, morphology of limbs and other structures, locomotion and other behaviors, and physiological characteristics such as respiration and nutrient uptake.\n\nA well-known example of an allometric relationshop is \n\nKleiber’s law, which posits that the basal metabolic rate of animals varies approximately as the animal’s mass raised to the \\frac{3}{4} power:\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A plot of Kleiber’s law, relating the metabolic rates of organisms to their sizes across a large range of sizes. See the Wikipedia article on \n\nKleiber’s law for details.\n\nAllometric relationships within taxonomic groups are usually determined by statistical analysis of observations across a range of organism sizes within the group.\nThese observations are most commonly plotted on log-log plots, and statistically analyzed to detect trends.\nA line on a log-log plot represents a power law relationship, which can be expressed mathematically astrait = c~size^p,\n\nwhere c is a constant, and p is an exponent indicating the type of allometry.\nTaking the log of both sides of [#K1] gives\\log{trait} = \\log{c} + p \\times \\log{ size}.\n\n[#K2] shows why power law allometries appear at straight lines on log-log plots.\n\nFor example, in \n\nFigure 1, the trait is \n\nBasal Metabolic Rate in watts, BMR, the size metric is mass, M, the constant c = 70, and the hypothesized exponent is p=\\frac{3}{4}, i.e.,BMR = 70~ M^\\frac{3}{4}\n\nIt is useful to distinguish two types of allometry, isometric scaling and allometric scaling.","type":"content","url":"/allometry","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size","lvl2":"Isometric scaling"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/allometry#isometric-scaling","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size","lvl2":"Isometric scaling"},"content":"Isometric scaling is also known as geometrical similarity.\nIn isometric scaling, all linear proportions are held constant as overall size increases or decreases.\nThe spherical egg model in \n\nthe previous notebook is an example of isometric scaling.\nIn general, a series of isometrically scaled objects follow the so-called \n\nsquare-cube law, stating that surface area is proportional to the length squared, and volume is proportional to length cubed.","type":"content","url":"/allometry#isometric-scaling","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size","lvl2":"Allometric scaling"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/allometry#allometric-scaling","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Allometry: How organismal characteristics vary with size","lvl2":"Allometric scaling"},"content":"In allometric scaling, different organismal traits scale differently with metrics of size.\nFor example, larger animals often have more robust bones than would be predicted by isometric scaling from smaller animals.\nIn a given organism, different traits may reflect either direct or indirect effects of isometric and allometric scaling.\n\nFor example, if a set of animals scaled isometrically, their weight might be expected to increase in proportion to the cube of their length.\nHowever, following the \n\nsquare-cube law, the cross-sectional area of their bones would increase only in proportion to the square of their length.\nThis is likely to result in much higher loading and risk of breakage in larger animals.\n\nIn this case, some traits of these animals might deviate from isometric scaling, and instead follow an allometric scaling.\nFor example, bones might increase in thickness faster than isometrically, or mass might increase slower than isometrically.\nEither form of allometric scaling would tend to equalize the loading on bones, relative to isometric scaling.","type":"content","url":"/allometry#allometric-scaling","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 An example Jupyter notebook"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/example","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 An example Jupyter notebook"},"content":"This is an example of a Jupyter notebook.

a working “executable” model; instructions how to use that model and suggested activities for exploring potential implications of the model for interesting questions in Larval Biology.\n\nIn most cases, background is presented in short form, often supplemented by separate “Quick Explainer” pages.\nThese pages are intended to be short enough for a reader to internalize the most relevant, essential facts about a topic refered to in a model, without losing continuity of thought while working with that model.\nQuick Explainers are not intended to be comprehensive, though ideally they may refer to additional sources that provide in-depth perspectives.\nIn many cases the most useful reference is simply a link to Wikipedia, which has proven to usually be comprehensive and accurate in many areas of biology, mathematics, physics, statistics and other disciplines.\n\nModels, instructions on how to use them, and activities applying the models to currently relevant questions in Larval Biology are presented in Jupyter notebooks.\nJupyter notebooks are among the latest and (so far) best platforms for embedding working computer code with formatted text and graphical content.\nJupyter notebooks can be combined and integrated with Markdown and other content in the form of an Executable Book.\nJupyter books can be run on a reader’s own computer, can be run online on platforms such as Binder, and can be freely exported using a drop-down menu as a static (non-executable) PDF document.\nWith additional setup, Jupyter books can also be exported as a LaTeX document, and then reconverted to a variety of other formats.\nThis flexibility in format and usage makes Jupyter books the best platform, at the time of this writing, for a book aimed at helping Larval Biologists gain experience working with models.\n\nThe source documents for the book can be downloaded (“cloned”) from GitHub at the book’s main repository, quant-larval-bio.\nThis repository belongs to the organismal-systems organization on GitHub, which is associated with the Organismal Systems Modeling Network.\nThe source documents can be used to fully build the book using \n\nJupyterBook.\n\nA static (read-only) version of the book constructed with GitHub Pages can be viewed online (or downloaded) at the **\n\norganismal-systems GitHub Pages site.\nThis version is quick and easy to read, and can be a useful reference alongside executable pages.\n\nOnline executable models implemented in \n\nJupyter notebooks are available with a button click through \n\nBinder.\nThe great advantage of these models is that they require nothing more than a browser to be running on users’ machines.\nThis makes them accessible to nearly everyone everywhere.\n\nAs with most free online resources, though, there are limitations.\nOne is that the execution speed can be slower, especially at peak times, compared to running the same model on a local workstation (it can also be faster, depending on the workstation...).\nAnother is that sessions “expire” after a period of inactivity, freeing computing resources for other users.\nThe session can easily be restarted, however, with the click of a button.\nIn some contexts, \n\nBinder implementations also have constraints on reading and writing data files.\n\nExecutable models running locally on your computer can be launched from downloaded copies of the source repositories, or from copies of those repositories already in the source materials for this book.\nExecutable Jupyter notebooks containing models (and supporting Python libraries, if needed) are also incorporated into the book as subrepos or submodules, which it git jargon for repositories that are incorporated as components of other repositories.\nThe source repositories for these models are stored elsewhere on GitHub, at links provided in the text.\nThese repositories are typically forked so that independent copies are retained on the OSYM GitHub site, from which they are linked in the book.\nThese repositories often have their own license requirements, which supercede (for that content) the licensing requirements for the original content of this book.\nThis structure is necessary for two reasons:\n\nThe Jupyter notebooks (and, often, a Python code library in which models are implemented) may be created and updated by different authors.\nHaving a separate repository for these models enables the authors to develop their own codes, avoiding requiring them to separately update a book implementation. It also avoids giving all authors editing access to the entire book content, which is not sustainable in the long run.\n\nDifferent models require different sets of Python libraries.\nSome of these libraries are quite voluminous, so requiring a user of one model to install all libraries relevant to any of the other models is problematic.\nMoreover, Python libraries are updated and modified frequently; it is quite possible for different models in the book to require conflicting, incompatible versions of the same library.\n\nThe easiest way to manage the libraries required to build the

area, A, and volume, V, of a spherical egg.\nWe could expect that A and V have signicance for an egg’s biology.\nFor example, we might expect its mass to be roughly proportional to its volume; that mass may have functional consequences for respiratory demands, development time, sinking or rising rates, etc.\nLikewise, we might expect its surface area to be related to gas exchange rates, encounter probability with sperm or pathogens, and other factors.\nIn this simplified example, these serve as a biological motivation for understanding how surface area and volume vary with size.\n\nBecause spheres have the same shape, all spheres are geometrical scale models of each other.\nAcross the set of spheres, there is a single parameter, the diameter d, that specifies a unique sphere.\nKnowing d, we can calculate the surface area A and volume V using familiar formulas:\n\nA = \\pi d^2\n\nV = \\frac{\\pi}{6} d^3\n\nAnticipating more complicated and realistic applications in Organismal Biology, let’s suppose we did not know these formulas.\nIn that case, we would expect to conduct a series of observations in which we measure the surface area and volume of a series of spheres of various sizes.\nWe could then use interpolation or curve-fitting to estimate the surface area and volume of spheres within the range of our measurements.\n\nInstead, lt’s consider using nondimensional ratios to express the formulas for A and V, in a more general form with fewer parameters.\nWe’ll start by choosing a characteristic length, L.\nThe geometry of the egg suggests that the most useful choice of characteristic value is the length scale corresponding to the diameter,\n\nL = d.\nFrom their units (m^3 for A, m^3 for V) we can anticipate that surface areas of shapes generally scale isometrically with the length scale squared, L^2, while the volume scales with the length scale cubed, L^3.\nWe know this because there is no other way to construct a quantity with the units of area and volume using the only available characteristic dimension, L.\n\nKnowing that A \\propto L^2 and  V \\propto L^3, we can set about measuring the constants of proportionality.\nDoing so for a conveniently sized sphere, we find that\n\nc_{A_{sphere}} = \\frac{A}{L^2} = \\pi\n\nc_{V_{sphere}} = \\frac{V}{L^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n\nThat is, our measurements tell us that the constant of proportionality c_{A_{sphere}} of surface area to L^2 is \\pi, and the constant of proportionality c_{V_{sphere}} of volume to L^3 is \\frac{\\pi}{6}.\n\nHaving measured one sphere, we are done.\nThat is, knowing c_{A_{sphere}} and c_{V_{sphere}}, we can write down A and V for spheres with any L (even those too large or small to measure).\nThat beats making new measurements for tens or hundreds of different-sized spheres!","type":"content","url":"/nondim-numbers#characteristic-dimensions-of-an-egg","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"📖 Non-dimensional numbers","lvl3":"What did we

common one in engineering, mathematics and physics but much less fully employed by Organismal Biologists.\nBefore moving on, it’s worth broadening our perspective with a few take-home points:\n\nThe logic leading to the shape constants c_{A_{sphere}} and c_{V_{sphere}} did not depend on the spherical shape, or on us having a formula.\nIt depended only on the basic scaling geometry, that areas and volumes of geometrically similar objects must be proportional to their length scale squared and cubed, respectively.\nIf you were to conduct the same measurement on a cube, you would find the same scaling but different shape constants (c_{A_{sphere}} = c_{V_{sphere}} = 1).\nFor any other shape – an ellipsiod, a dodecahedron, or a lobster – corresponding pair of shape constants summarize the area and volume across all sizes.\n\nThe nondimensionalization exploited the fact that all spheres are scale models of each other, so that only one needed to be measured rather than an infinite spectrum of diameters.\nIn mathematical jargon, it reduced the dimensionality of the problem.\nDimensionality is the number of variable along which we have to measure to characterize a phenomenon.\nIn this simplified case, nondimensionalization reduced the dimensionality from 1 axis (diameter) to none (all spheres have the same constants).\nEven in this simple case, reducing a hypothetical series of measurements from a series to a single observation represents a significant savings.In a more relevant problem in Organismal Biology, there may be many axes of variation.\nIn such a case, reducing the number of parameters to vary is even more helpful.\n\nAs stated, this example started with an extremely simple calculation, which the analysis made still simpler.\nThe real utility of non-dimensionalization is found in application to more complex problems in Organismal Biology, in which there are many independent variables and for which no formulas are available.\nIn these cases, including examples found in the following chapters of this book, a reduction in the number of parameters and an orderly separation of effects of different elements of the problem can be very useful and insightful.","type":"content","url":"/nondim-numbers#nondimensionalization-as-a-general-approach","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Why use models in Organismal Biology?"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/overview-1","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ Why use models in Organismal Biology?"},"content":"Organismal Biology is, historically, a mostly experimental disciplne.\nOrganismal Biologists have frequently pushed experimental technological boundaries.\nExamples include confocal microscopy and other computerized imaging techniques; molecular techniques to identify taxa, measure population connectivity and understand patterns of development; and many other areas.\nThis innovative spirit has not reached similar levels in applying quantitative approaches like mathematical modeling and computer simulations to Organismal Biology.\nMathematical models have so far made only modest contributions to Organismal Biology.\nThe potential of mathematical tools to contribute to Organismal Biology, however, is much broader and deeper than the current literature reflects.\n\nOne reason thinking about and using models can benefit Organismal Biologists is that much of what we do already implicitly assumes some type of modeling framework.\nFor example, all statistics are based on underlying models about probability distributions and random processes that emerge from them (independent events, normal distributions, etc.).\nNearly all measurements of environmental characteristics (temperature, pH, salinity, etc.) are based on electrical measurements as proxies for the quantity being measured.\nThe resistance or voltage being measured is translated into the environmental quantity using models.\nEven more broadly, most experimental design is based (often on an unspoken, intuitive level) on assumptions about how a measurement or manipulation carries implications for a biological process – in other words, a model.\n\nA great many scientists who undertake statistical tests, use environmental sensors or design experiments have little awareness of the ways their work is based solidly on modeling.\nBetter awareness of the modeling already involved in their work, especially if they also approach their investigations with a quantitative framework in mind, could result in a very satisfying synergy:\nModelers who also undertake experiments can design more innovative and insightful models.\nExperimentalists equipped with a modeling perspective can have insights that enable them to design better, more compelling experiments.\nThe best modeling of all is modeling while experimenting, when moving quickly between the computer and the laboratory or field site makes the connections between nature and models especially thought-provoking.\n\nDisseminating some of the background knowledge and experience for using models, and the understanding of why using models is a productive adjunct to traditional approaches in Organismal Biology, is a primary objective of this book.\nA future Organismal Biology in which the potential of models to enhance discovery is more fully exploited – in which quantitative models are freely interdigitated among empirical methods and observations where each approach can best contribute  – would be a more interesting, productive and impactful discipline.\n\nSome of the reasons Organismal Biologists might be interested in quantitative models are:\n\nModels are tools for inferring the logical consequences of specific assumptions.\n\nThe emphasis here is on the “specific assumptions” as much as on the “logical consequences”.\nIn a career of modeling biological processes in which I believed I was well versed, and of helping other biologists to formulate models in their own areas of expertise, I have consistently encountered two phenomena:\n\nFormulating a mathematical model requires specificity in details that are easy to overlook in conceptual thinking:\nExactly how is a process like morphogenesis, synchronized spawning, predator avoidance or gene flow regulated?\nIn what way are an egg, an early embryo, a larva and an adult “individuals” in a population model?\nI have been frequently flummoxed (and delighted) while modeling to discover basic aspects I had never thought about in organismal systems I thought I knew well.\nWriting down a quantitative model, even if results are never calculated, exposes these details and the intriguing new insights and questions that arise from them.\n\nDifferent scientists, especially scientists from different disciplines, use the same word with very different meanings.\nThis means that interdisciplinary collaborations, which are necessary and productive in Organismal Biology, are frequently derailed by misunderstandings between two experts who have firm, well-founded (but different) interpretations of the subject at hand.\nAn example is “memory”.\nTo a mathematician or statistician, a “memoryless system” is one in which the current state determines the probabilities of future events, without regard to how the current state was brought about.\nThus, a mathematician could happily formulate a “memoryless” model of the human brain.\nClearly, this would not be a biologist’s interpretation.\nConfounding vocabulary and other vagueness in terminology are usually clarified when the relevant biological mechanisms are expressed in mathematical form.\n\nModels are tools for inferring what we want to know from what we can measure.\n\nOrganismal Biology is frequently hampered by quantities and characteristics  that we want to know but cannot directly measure.\nWhat are the fitness implications of variants we observe in morphology, size, behavior, geography, or seasonality?\nWhat are the mechanisms responsible for patterns in speciation and extinction, for species range expansion and contraction, or for the prevalence or rarity of different life history strategies?\nHow is recruitment of a juvenile cohort limited or enhanced by each of the numerous biotic and abiotic environmental variables at a given time and place?\nHow are environmental signals transduced by sensory and regulatory processes into reproductive, foraging or mortality events?\n\nAll of these questions, and many more, involve unknowns that are difficult or impossible to measure.\nModeling provides approaches to infer quantities that cannot be measured.\nFor example, it is in most cases impractical to measure the mortality rates of organisms in most terrestrial and marine environments.\nDirect measurements would involve unobtrusive observations following a large sample size of individuals, recording whether and how they died.\nIn most cases, this is not possible to carry out.\nAn alternative is to track cohorts of juveniles, measuring changes in abundance, age- and stage- structure, and geographic distribution.\nFrom cohort data, combined with a modeling framework that provides quantitative predictions based on alternative mortality regimes, inferences can be made regarding plausible rates and mechanisms of mortality in the observed juvenile population (e.g. \n\nSchneider et al. (2003)).\n\nAnother way in which observations are constrained is in considering the consequences of hypothetical alternatives to observed characteristics such as morphology or life history.\nOrganisms that do not exist cannot be observed, but models that correctly reflect the key underlying mechanisms can give quantitative assessments of how hypothetical variations of extant organisms might function.\nThese models could give insight into why these variant don’t exist, in the context of implied changes in performance or distribution, or evolutionary costs and benefits.\n\nModels are tools for communicating biological knowledge across organizational levels.\n\nAnother way in which models can contribute to insights in Organismal Biology is by integrating specialized knowledge from different disciplines.\nFor example, biologists investigating maternal allocation to reproduction – how many eggs of what size mom should make each year – may focus on the physiology of egg production, the energy inputs and outputs of mature females, and coordination of spawning to maximize fertilization success.\nHowever, they would not be able to draw inferences about the costs and benefits of the traits they observe without context:\nWhat are the functional consequences of smaller or larger juveniles in terms of habitat selection, food capture and predator avoidance?\nWhat are the geographic implications of shorter or longer dispersal phases, and do those have implications for maintaining viable self-sustaining populations?\nHow do impacts in present environments compare to historical environments, or future environments affected by climate change?\n\nEach of these questions draws in the expertise of other scientists, whose understanding can be exploited by investigators of an organism’s reproductive biology.\nBiomechanical models may provide them with specific estimates of how locomotion and sensory performance is likely to differ in smaller or larger offspring.\nDemographic models may offer quantitative insight into the consequences of variations in maturation time and dispersal.\nGeophysical circulation models may predict the transport of propagules in winds, tides and currents, and environmental characteristics such as temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll and pH that may affect recruitment.\nClimate models may specify the environmental conditions in relevant to past and future environments.\nIn all these cases, quantitative models formulated at one biological or environmental level can be leveraged by investigators at another level.\nLeveraging models in this way provides a mechanisms for community level collaborations, in which investigators make their discoveries available in the form of publicly available and easily used toolkits.\nThis approach would mark a change for Organismal Biology, but would be following the productive pathways of other disciplines such as statistics, geophysical modeling and molecular biology.\n\nModels let you make scientific discoveries anytime, anywhere.\n\nBeyond all of these reasons, one additional point which has given me satisfaction is worth mentioning:\nMany interesting and important organisms are available only at narrowly constrained times and places, commonly a certain interval in spring or early summer, at a field station, marine lab  or offshore location.\nExperimental work in Organismal Biology grinds to a halt outside this very limited window in space and time.\nModeling is portable and extends the productive working season of a Organismal Biologist to year-round.\nA novel insight in Organismal Biology, even if obtained on a computer rather than a microscope, is equally thrilling in the dark winter months!","type":"content","url":"/overview-1","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic similarity"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/scale-models","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮

examples reflect geometric similarity.\nThat is, the derived objects are scale models because their components have geometries that are similar in proportion to the originals*.","type":"content","url":"/scale-models","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic similarity","lvl3":"Dynamic similarity"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/scale-models#dynamic-similarity","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic similarity","lvl3":"Dynamic similarity"},"content":"The concept of similarity can be extended to include forces acting on objects and their surroundings.\nThis concept is called \n\n“dynamic similarity” or “similitude”.\nScale models are dynamically similar if, in addition to being geometrically similar in proportion, the different forces acting on them are also similar in proportion.\n\nThe additional requirement of equal proportional forces means that not all geometrically similar scale models are dynamically similar.\nWe all have an intuitive grasp of this fact.\nTo illustrate this, let’s look at video of a scale model of the Titanic sailing on a body of water:\n\nAs you watch this video, consider your intuition about how big the model is.\n\n# A convenient way to play this video from YouTube in a Jupyter notebook cell is \n#shown in this post:\n#

on a pond.\ndisplay_yotube_video(\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hghNqCZmso\", width=800, height=600)\n\n\n\nWhat is your intuitive estimate of the size of this model?\n\nThe model in this video is a very detailed scale model of the Titanic.\nIt is geometrically similar in nearly every visible detail, and in a great many that are not visible.\nThere is little direct information about the size of the model (such as a ruler, human hand or other object of known scale)\nNonetheless, it is immediately apparent from watching the video that this model is not 267 meters long, like the full sized Titanic was.\nWhat is it about the video that makes the model seem smaller?\n\nIt is the context of the water motion.\nThe water is behaving as water always does, and the model is geometrically similar.\nHowever, the relative motion of the water waves and model are out of proportion with each other, compared to a full sized ship moving in the ocean.\n\nThat is, the forces moving the ship and the forces moving the water are not in the proper proportions.\nTherefore, this geometrically similar model is not dynamically similar.\n\nOur intuition based on many experiences watching lakes, oceans, pools and other water bodies gives us a sense of scale for waves.\nThe model gives little indication of its size, but the size scale suggested by our intuition for the water waves tells us that the model is only about a meter long (it’s actually a 1:212 scale model, with a length of roughly 1.25m).\n\n","type":"content","url":"/scale-models#dynamic-similarity","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic similarity","lvl4":"Ship model basins","lvl3":"Dynamic

are dramatically more reminiscent of those from a full sized ship than the Titanic video.\nIn fact, if it were not for the people on the moving gantry, it would be difficult to estimate the size of these scale models just by observing their interactions with the water.\nThe difference betwen the two videos is that the models in the second video are set up by engineers to be dynamically similar, while the first model is not.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/scale-models#ship-model-basins","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic similarity","lvl2":"Establishing dynamic

as\n\n{\\mathcal{Fr}} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{g L}}\n\nwere g is gravitational acceleration.\n\nIf a scale model of the ship which has length L_{model} travels at speed U_{model}, its Froud number

which water waves travel.\nThis speed is a function of their wavelength, L_w (the distance between neighboring crests): water waves’ speed is (in the ideal case) proportional to \\sqrt{L_w} (and to g, the gravitational acceleration).\nThe Froud number is the ratio of the full sized ship’s speed, divided by the estimated speed of a wave equal in length to the ship.\n\nWhy do the relative lengths of the ship and wave matter?\nIt is because a moving ship generates waves traveling around the same speed it’s traveling.\nThat means a slow ship is generating slow, short waves.\nAs the ship increases speed, it generates faster, longer waves.\n\nA ship can effectively “straddle” and plow through waves that are much shorter than its hull.\nHowever, when a wave starts to get to as long or longer than the hull, the ship’s stern gets caught in the trough while the bow is raised in the crest.\nThat means that, in effect, the ship is continuously going uphill!\nWhen this happens, an increase in propulsive power just adds to the size of the wave being generated – it has almost no effect on ship speed.\n\nIn effect, the length of the hull imposes a “speed limit”: the speed of waves as long as the ship.\nThis is known as the hull speed.\nThe faster hull speeds of longer vessels is one of the reasons racing shells, hunting kayaks, container ships and many other watercraft for which speed is important tend to be long.\n\nThe Froud number, \\cal{Fr}, is a ship’s speed expressed as a fraction of its hull speed.\nA model with matching Froud number – that is, traveling at the same fraction of its hull speed -- will both in appearance and in the quantitative measures of force and motion match the full sized ship.\nThat is, the ship and model will be dynamically similar.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/scale-models#why-does-the-froud-number-determine-dynamic-similarity-for-ships-and-ship-models","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Scale models and dynamic

ship or model &ndash that have the same units, \\frac{m}{s}.\nBecause the units of the numerator and denomenator cancel, the Froud number is dimensioness.\n\nThe Froud number is one of many indices in engineering, physics and biology that has this characteristic. These indices are usually referred to with the slightly unintuitive name \n\nnon-dimensional numbers (also known as “dimensionless quantities”).\nNondimensional indices that express the ratio of two lengths, speeds, masses, rates or other characteristics relevant to an organism’s biology are often informative about that organism’s function.\n\nFor example, you may already be familiar with a nondimensional number from epidemiology: the pathogen reproductive number, \\mathcal{R}.\n\\mathcal{R} is the number of new infections caused by a primary infection before it is cleared.\nIf \\mathcal{R}<1, then each successing round of infection is smaller; the infected population is then decreasing, and an epidemic is not possible.\nIf \\mathcal{R}>1, then each successing round of infection is larger; the infected population is increasing and an epidemic can occur.\n\nBy summarizing the conditions under which an epidemic is or is not possible, the nondimensional index \\mathcal{R} highlights factors that make epidemics more likely (those that incease \\mathcal{R}, such as high contact rates among susceptibles and poor hygiene) and those that make epidemics less likely (those that decrease \\mathcal{R}, such as reduction in susceptibility through vaccination and good hygiene).\n\nBecause nondimensional numbers play similarly useful roles in many aspects of Organismal Biology, it is worth thinking about them in some detail.","type":"content","url":"/scale-models#nondimensional-numbers","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Terms of

C_d are functions of particle velocity, U, (see the equations above).\nHowever, because we don’t in general have a convenient formula for C_d, we can’t write down an analytical formula to obtain the U

problems are doing.\nBelow, I’ve made a calculator that does this iteration for you.\n\nBefore trusting in the software, however, it’s important that you gain some first-hand experience with this

Law in a different and possibly more intuitive way,\\mathit{sum~of~forces} = \\mathit{rate~of~change~of~momentum}\n\nHopping onto our bicycles again, this expresses another familiar phenomenon:\nWhen we apply force to the pedals, we produce a forward force which increases our momentum (by speeding us up).\nWhen we apply brakes, we produce a backwards force which decreases our momentum (by slowing us down).","type":"content","url":"/rs1intro#the-righthand-side-mass-times-acceleration","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️ What makes organisms move through fluids (and what slows them

and velocity changes.\nThe ideas in that discussion are then used in assessing scaling of forces on organisms immersed in fluids:\n\nHow do forces increase or decrease with organism size and velocity?\n\nHow can we understand consequences of organism shape, as opposed to variations in size?\n\nIn what ways is being immersed in air different from (or similar to) being immersed in water or another fluid?\n\nThe results of the scaling analysis are then used in a worksheet that provides tools to ask more specific questions, such as “How fast will a given organism sink or float in a given

This means that it has both a magnitude and a direction. This is distinct from “speed”, “celerity” and other terms that have only magnitude (that is, they are scalars).

meaning that they release their gametes into the water.\nSperm must encounter eggs for \n\nfertilization to happen, but this is more challenging than it might seem.\nThat’s because the surrounding water is almost always moving, due to waves, currents and tides.\nMovement of the water into which gametes are released means that in a very short time – possibly within a few seconds – these gametes have been moved far from the adults that released them.\nThough sperm are motile, their swimming abilities do not enable them to find and fertilize eggs that have been transported over long distances.\n\nThis has important consequences for the life histories of many species.\nMarine invertebrates typically accumulate metabolic resources to produce gametes for months or even years before spawning.\nOnce spawning begins, however, it’s essential that multiple individuals precisely synchronize the timing of spawning.\nIf an individual is early or late, its eggs will not encounter sperm to fertilize it, or its sperm will not encounter eggs to fertilize.\nThis risk of reproductive failure leads to behavioral strategies such as formation of large colonies or reproductive aggregations; use of environmental cues such as moon phases; and chemical communication among reproductive adults.\n\nGiven synchronized spawning, successful reproduction then depends on maximizing encounters of eggs with approriate concentrations of sperm, sufficient to make fertilization successful but not so dense as to make \n\npolyspermy likely.\nThe encounter rate of eggs with sperm – and hence, reproductive success – is determined in large part by how fast these gametes sink, rise or swim, along with the rates at which they are transported, mixed and diluted by environmental flows.","type":"content","url":"/rs2context#reproductive-biology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"📖️ Transport of organisms by currents and turbulence","lvl3":"Agriculture","lvl2":"Examples of

using the calculators in \n\nthis worksheet.\nIf we know the height at which pesticide particles were released, we can use the sinking rate to estimate how long it takes pesticide particles to arrive

scenario, as particles sink vertically they are carried horizontally from the release point by the wind.\nIf you have walked downwind of a sprinkler or fountain in a stiff wind you are familiar with this phenomenon.\n\nIn the windy scenario, sinking time has a consequence that is potentially much more important than a delayed arrival time at the paddy: a long delay and strong wind might mean the pesticide arrives at ground level far downwind.\nIt may even miss the rice paddy entirely, landing instead on a different area which may be occupied by people, grazed by livestock or have other sensitive uses.\n\nThe ways in which sprayed pesticides, pollen, dust and a great many other anthropogenic and natural particles are transported and ultimately deposited are determined by their

and buoyancy.\nIn contrast, the principal direction of wind, currents and many other environmental flows is often horizontal.\nIn such cases, advection causes movement in directions those organisms would not otherwise move.\n\nEven when an organism has some horizontal movement, horizontal advective transport can be orders of magnitude faster than swimming movements.\nFor example, in many aquatic environments, characteristics such as light, temperature and nutrient availability change over a few meters in the vertical direction but are relatively constant over many kilometers in the horizontal direction.\nThe slow swimming of organisms such as plankton is often considered fast enough to regulate their access to light, warmth and nutrients by moving up or down in the water column.\nHowever, horizontal swimming at the same rate can have negligble effects, because their environment varies so slowly in the horizontal direction.\nIn these cases, only long-range advection by currents can move

high adection and low turbulence; low advection and high turbulence, high advection and high turbulence, etc.\nThe \n\nnext worksheet gives us tools for quantitatively assessing the consequences of these different scenarios for different types of particles.\n\nThe phenomenon of population, mass, momentum, energy or any other conserved quantity being carried by moving fluid is called advection or convection.\nDifferent fields in the natural sciences and engineering use these terms slightly differently, but in all cases they imply that moving fluid transports a conserved quantity.\n\nEven this

over time and at different heights in intensity and direction; we will neglect this variation.\n\nWe’ll also assume that turbulent intensity, as summarized by the turbulent diffusion coefficient K, is also equal at all times and places.\nIn reality, turbulence would also vary in time and space, but we will again neglect this complication.\n\nWe’ll assume that, once they hit the gound, seeds stick to it and are not dispersed into the air again.\n\nFinally, we’ll assume that at large scales the advective transport is much faster than the turbulent mixing. That is, we assume that turbulent mixing is significant in the vertical direction but can be ignored in the horizontal directions, because advective transport by the wind is much greater.\nThis is mostly a technical detail, because it is almost always true for most parts of environmental flows, but this assumption can have consequences in specific parts of the environment (very near the source, very near the ground, etc.).\n\nIf we accept these assumptions, we can calculate formulas for the concentration of seeds in different parts of the atmosphere surrounding the seed source, and for the rate at which seeds are deposited on the ground at various downstream distances.\nThese formulas are calculated for you in the Gaussian Plume calculator below.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/rs2exec","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/rs2exec#model-rationale","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"content":"The rationale of the Gaussian plume model is that it breaks the three components of movement:\n\nthe advection due to wind velocity, W\n\nthe spreading in the vertical direction by turbulence, K\n\nthe sinking velocity, U\n\ninto sequential, additive steps.\n\nSeparating the movement mechanisms makes it easy to approximate the resutling distributions and deposition patterns, in the following ways:\n\nSeeds (or other particles of interest) are transported horizontally downwind at a steady velocity, W.\n\nAs they move downwind, the vertical distribution of seeds is spreading due to the turbulent diffusion, to take the shape of a Gaussian distribution with a variance that increases over time at a rate proportional to K.\n\nThe vertical position of the mean of the Gaussian distribution of seeds is descending over time, due to the sinking velocity U.\n\nFollowing these steps, a formula can be written for the spatial distribution of seeds and their deposition rate.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/rs2exec#model-rationale","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl3":"Model Inputs:","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/rs2exec#model-inputs","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl3":"Model Inputs:","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"content":"In the default settings (to reproduce these, just restart the kernel in the menu at the top left):\n\nthe seed source is set to h = 10 m;\n\nthe seed’s sinking speed is U = 0.5 \\frac{m}{s};\n\nthe rate at which seeds are released is one per second: n = 1 s^{-1};\n\nthe default wind speed is W = 1 \\frac{m}{s}; and,\n\nthe default turbulent mixing intensity is K = 0.5 \\frac{m^2}{s}.\n\nYou can modify these as needed to apply to a specific problem, by entering a new value in a textbox and hitting enter.\n\nFor example, in calculating the distribution pattern of marine invertebrate eggs, or pesticide droplets from aerial spraying, you might calculate the sinking speed of these particle using \n\nthis worksheet, and use the calculator below to explore the consequences of various release heights, wind or current speeds, turbulence intensities, etc.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/rs2exec#model-inputs","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl3":"Model outputs:","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/rs2exec#model-outputs","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Models of particle transport by advection and turbulence","lvl3":"Model outputs:","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"content":"The model output is in the form of three plots.\n\nThe top graph is the total rate of deposition as a function of downstream distance from the source.

or water.\nFor example, the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere into the ocean is affected by how fast carbon fixed by phytoplankton sinks into the deep ocean.\nThe sinking rate for a given phytoplankton cell can vary greatly depending on whether it is eaten by zooplankton and excreted into large, fast-sinking fecal pellets or lysed by a viral infection into tiny slow-sinking subcellular fragments.\nThe rate and direction of range shifts by plants in response to climate change, or the ability to colonize new habitat patches, may depend on the sinking rates of windblown or current-borne propagules.\nFor an aquatic microorganism, its position in a water column that varies in temperature, light, nutrient availability and density of predators and prey may depend on its vertical movement relative to the water around it.\nFrom a more applied perspective, the “drift” of corn pollen from genetically modified plants into neighboring fields of organic corn depends on the sinking rate of the pollen particles.\nGeneralizing even more, the “footprint” of land contaminated by pollutant particles emitted by a sewage outfall or smokestack, or ocean fertilized by iron in wind-blown dust, depends on how fast these particles sink.\nYou can think of many other examples.\n\nIn addition to effects on spatial distributions, movement through fluids can also

\\frac{m}{s^2} is the gravitational acceleration.\n\nPressure forces:\n\nAs you know from your ears, if you have dived to the bottom of a swimming pool, \n\npressure increases with depth.\nThat implies that the pressure acting on the bottom surface of a particle is stronger than the pressure acting on the top of that particle (because the bottom is deeper than the top).\n\nSince the pressure pushing upwards on the bottom of the particle is stronger that the pressure pushing downwards on the top of the particle, the net force of this pressure is an upward force, which we call buoyancy.\nIt turns out that this force is always equal to the gravitational force on the mass of fluid that the particle displaces, but opposite in direction (that is, the buoyancy tends to push particles upwards while gravity pulls them downwards).\n\nThis gives us the familiar sinking vs. floating phenomena: If a particle is denser than the fluid, its mass is greater than the mass of the displaced fluid, and hence it has a net downward force (gravity exceeds buoyancy). Therefore it sinks.\nIf the particle is less dense than the fluid, buoyancy exceeds gravity, and it floats.\n\nIf the particle is moving,\n\nViscous forces:\n\nViscosity is a measure of how “thick” a fluid is.\nIn engineering terms, viscosity is the resistance to the motion of two parallel plates sliding past one another (this motion is called shear).\nFor example, fluids like honey, molasses and glycerine have much higher viscosity than fluids like water and air.\n\nThis means that dragging a particle through a more viscous fluid like honey at a given velocity requires much more force than dragging the same particle at the same velocity through a less viscous fluid like water or air.\n\nGravity, pressure (including buoyancy) and viscous forces all contribute to the sum of forces on the left hand side of the equation for Newton’s 2nd Law, as applied to an immersed particle.\n\nIn a few rare but interesting cases, other forces such as magnetism are important!\n\nNote that F_{gravity} is a vector, which means simply that it has both a magnitude (9.81 \\times M) and a direction (down).\n\nYou may also have felt the opposite: “popping” in your ears from the decrease in air pressure as an airplane takes off.","type":"content","url":"/rsforces","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"💡️ “Look-up tables” for drag forces on moving

dramatically shrinks the number of experimental observations or numerical computations we need to characterize particle movement in fluids.\nThat is because it enables us to make and interpret scale models.\nIf we observe or compute one example of drag forces on an organism moving in fluid, the Reynolds number tells us how to translate that result to any geometrically similar organism in any fluid, as long as it has the same Reynolds number.\n\nAs an example, let’s consider the general problem of drag forces on spherical organisms moving through a variety of fluids (air, water of different salinities, blood, mucus, etc.).\nAs with many biomechanics models, assuming an organism is spherical applies to a few organisms exactly, but to a great many organsims approximately.\nOur goal is to create a \n\nlookup table that tabulates the drag forces on these organisms, to understandhow fast they rise or sink, as biomechanical consequences of size, habitat etc.\n\nTo cover relevant biological applications, we have at least four parameters to vary:\n\norganism size, L\n\norganism velocity, U\n\nfluid viscosity \\mu\n\nfluid density, \\rho\n\nIf we need 20 values of each parameter to fully characterize the parameter space for our lookup table, we need to make 20^4  = 160000 observations.\nFurthermore, some of these observations are difficult or impossible, such as measuring the forces on bacterium-sized organisms.\n\nThe Reynolds number rescues us from this difficult situation.\nWe know that all geometrically similar organisms with the same \\mathcal{Re} are scale models of each other (that is, they are dynamically similar).\nThis means we need only make one observation for each value of \\mathcal{Re}; from this observation, we can calculate all the specific instances of organisms, fluids etc. with the same Reynolds number.\n\nFor example, we can choose one convenient organism size (L), and a convenient fluid (with a given visosity, \\mu, and density, \\rho).\nWe can then measure drag forces across a range of velocity, U, giving us the complete range of \\mathcal{Re} we need to span the biologically interesting applications.\nThis gives us a lookup table that covers the whole range of organisms by measuring only 20 different values of \\mathcal{Re}!\n\nTo use this concise approach, we need a formula for converting the drag forces on one organism to another organism that is dynamically similar.\nThat formula has been provided by engineers and fluid mechanicists, and is called the \n\nCoefficient of Drag, C_d (also called the Drag Coefficient).\nThe formula for C_d isC_d  = \\frac{F}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho L^2 U^2}\n\nThe Coefficient of Drag has been measured or calculated for many shapes, as for example for \n\nspheres.\n\nAlso

changes in the organism’s momentum result from changes in its velocity.\n\nHowever, for organisms immersed in fluids, there is another factor: To move, an organism or any other particle must also displace fluid around itself.\nThe water that is moved in concert with an organism must be accounted for in assessing the relationship between forces and movement.\nThere are two primary ways in which

person rowing a boat (or had a chance to row one yourself) you have seen the shape of an oar.\nAt one end the oar has a handle, where it is gripped by the rower.\nAt the other end, the oar is the “blade”, which is wide and flat but quite thin.\n\nTo propel the boat, the rower inserts the oar into the water with the blade perpendicular to the direction the boat is moving, before pulling.\nIt is intuitive that this is necessary to row effectively – if the blade were parallel to the direction of motion, it would slice easily through the water and provide very little propulsion.\n\nDespite it being intuitive, few people (including rowers) have thought about why this is the case?\nWhen an oar is pulled through the water, its mass is the same whether it’s perpendicular or parallel to the direction of motion.\nWhat then is the difference?\n\nThe difference is \n\nadded mass, the engineering term for fluid that must be moved when an object moves through a fluid.\nFor example, when the oar is pulled in a perpendicular position, water next to the front and back of the blade moves with it.\nBecause the perpendicular blade has a large area in line with its motion, this is a lot of water.\nThis water is the added mass of the oar.\nAccelerating this added mass of water is what makes the oar effective, and oars are designed specifically to have large added mass when pulled in the perpendicular position.\n\nIn contrast, the parallel blade has a small area in line with its motion, so it moves relatively little water.\nThat is, it has little added mass.\nIt is said to be streamlined, which means it moves with little resistance through the fluid.\n\nIn a well-designed oar, the added mass in its “power” orientation is much larger than the mass of the blade itself.\nThe same is true of many appendages of organisms that propell themselves through water.\nWhile other fluid dynamical mechanisms are also operating, thinking in terms of added mass often provides useful insights into the biomechanics of movement through fluids.","type":"content","url":"/rsmasses#added-mass","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️  Momentum changes due to “added mass” and “wake

constant and its rate of change is zero.\nNewton’s 2nd Law says that if your momentum is not changing, the sum of forces on you must be zero.\nHowever there is quite definitely a wind force acting on you.\nHow does this make sense?\n\nIt makes sense because, though your body’s momentum is not changing, by blocking the wind you are constantly changing the momentum of the air around you.\nSpecifically, you are creating a \n\nwake downwind of yourself, and that wake has less momentum than the air that is approaching you from upwind.\n\nTo understand the basic mechanism, let’s think about a simplified geometry:\nLet’s assume that your have a profile area (perpendicular to the wind) of 1m^2.\nThe wind speed upwind of you is 10 \\frac{m}{s} (about 11 mph).\nThat means roughly 10 m^3 of air, corresponding to a little over 12 kg, is encountering your body every second.\nThe momentum in that air is 10 m^3 \\times 12 kg – a considerable amount.\n\nHowever your body is blocking that air, so that downstream of you there is a zone in which wind speed is greatly reduced.\nIf the air in this zone has zero velocity (an oversimplification, but still a useful rough estimate) then, by blocking the wind, you are subtracting 120 m^3kg of momentum each second from the air as it passes you.\nThis requires force, that is the force that you feel as wind pressure and provide by opposing it with your feet.\n\nThis idea – that a moving organism creates a wake that requires force to maintain even if its own momentum is constant – is key to understanding both how organisms are shaped by evolution to minimize costs of locomotion and how forces on moving organisms scale with basic characteristics such as size and velocity.","type":"content","url":"/rsmasses#wake-momentum","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🏞️  Momentum changes due to “added mass” and “wake

the momentum of the fluid it encounters (the “wake momentum”) requires force, which the object experiences as drag.\n\nAdded mass and wake momentum are continually acting on our own bodies, because we are immersed in a fluid (air).\nBecause our bodies are so much denser than air, we usually don’t feel these effects, but under some circumstances (bicycling, swimming, windy days, etc.) they become

For example, it could be that species A has faster uptake of high-concentration nutrients but species B has faster uptake of low-concentratin nutrients. If the nutrient is limiting, it will be driven down to low concentrations, so species B is “better” in competitive terms, even though under other circumstances species B might have higher growth. For example, under predation, both populations might be reduced so that nutrients are not limiting, and species B might predominate.","type":"content","url":"/evolutionarilystablestates","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"️💡️  A “quota” model of diatom demography"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/litchman-etal2009","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"️💡️  A “quota” model of diatom demography"},"content":"Litchman et al.'s model of competing diatom variants uses the idea of nutrient “quotas” to understand the allometric differences between large and small diatoms in traits such as growth and nutrient consumption.\nIn this context, “growth” refers to cell division – that is, growth of the cell population rather than increase in a given cell’s size.\nIn their model, quotas represent nutrient storage within cells.\nWhen cell take up nutrients, they are placed directly into storage, increasing the cell’s quota.\nWhen the cell grows or divides, it consumes nutrients from its storage, decreasing its quota.\n\nStorage of nutrients has a consequence that is central to Litchman et al.'s hypothesis about the larger diatoms present in marine compared to freshwater habitats:\n\nCell growth is determined not by the current nutrient concentration in the water, but by the nutrient quota that reflects past nutrient concentrations.\n\nThey hypothesized that  differences in quotas, quantified by the observed allometries in nutrient storage capacity and uptake rates, interact with the fluctuating conditions within mixed layers to favor larger diatoms in marine habitats and smaller diatoms in freshwater habitats.\nSpecifically, they hypothesized that, large diatoms with disproportionately large storage can continue growing under some conditions, when small diatoms have exhausted their quotas and ceased to grow.","type":"content","url":"/litchman-etal2009","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"️💡️  A “quota” model of diatom demography","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/litchman-etal2009#model-rationale","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"️💡️  A “quota” model of diatom demography","lvl2":"Model rationale"},"content":"The rationale for Litchman et al.‘s model is based on accounting for nutrient concentration in the mixed layer, the numbers of cells of different diatom variants, and those cells’ nutrient quotas.\nThese variants differ in size, and because of allometry also in nutrient storage and uptake rates, growth rates, sinking velocity and many other traits.\n\nThe rate at which the number of cells of a given diatom variant changes \n\nbetween mixing events can be summarized as:\\mathrm{change~in~cell~number} = \\mathrm{growth} -

Smaller cells also have better ability to absorb very dilute nutrients.\nFurthermore, smaller cells have faster reproductive rates when replete with nutrients than larger cells.\nEach of these factors favor smaller cells, raising an even more fundamental question,\n\nWhy do large diatoms exist, when small ones have advantages in both nutrient uptake and maximum growth rate?\n\nA hypothezed factor frequently cited as favoring large cells is size-specific predation: the idea that smaller cells have a higher risk of predation, or of infection by pathogens, than larger cells.\nLarger cells would then be maintained not because they can grow faster but because they suffer lower predator- or pathogen-induced mortality rates than small cells.\nThis type of regulation of a population by higher trophic levels is called \n\ntop-down control.\n\nLitchman et al. hypothesized that additional answers to both of these questions are found in \n\nbottom-up control, modulated by the phenomena in oceans and lakes called \n\nMixed layers.\n\nIn Organismal Biology, the term aquatic is usually interpreted as referring to a water habitat that may be either marine (saltwater) or freshwater.\n\nEstimates of the number of species ranging from 20,000 to as high as 200,000.","type":"content","url":"/marinefreshdiatoms","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"📖️  Diatoms and mixed

meaning that there is vertical variation in water properties such as temperature and salinity.\nTypically, surface waters tend (at least seasonally) to be higher temperature (e.g., because they are warmed by the sun or warm air).\nIn marine environments, surface layers also often have lower salinity than deeper waters (in coastal regions, this can result from river inflows).\nThis variation, in which  water in surface layers is less dense than water in deeper layers, is known as stable stratification.\n\nIn the absence of a mechanism to energetically stir water in a stably stratified water column, lighter near-surface water will remain near-surface indefinitely, and denser deep water will stay deep.\nThe primary stirring mechanism in many oceanic and lake environments is wind, which causes waves, currents and tubulence in surface waters.\nStirring from wind typically overcomes stratification near the surface.\nHowever, it usually penetrates only partway into a water column.\n\nWithin this near-surface zone of penetration, wind-induced turbulence mixes water so that temperature and salinity are relatively uniform.\nThis zone is called the \n\nmixed layer.\nWithin the mixed layer, stratification has been lost, so that cells or nutrients at one level within the mixed layer can easily be transported by turbulence to another level within the mixed layer.\n\nHowever, there remains a density difference between water in the mixed layer and deeper water.\nThat means it takes substantial extra energy to mix lighter mixed layer water with denser water from below the mixed layer.\nThis extra energy is supplied only episodically, by events such as storms and internal waves.\n\nLike phytoplankton in general, diatoms typically inhabit the mixed layer within aquatic environments, where there is sunlight to fuel photosynthesis.\nBecause they are in low-density surface water, they may be moved within the mixed layer but are rarely carried below it into deep, unlit water.\n\nAs these cells grow and reproduce, they consume the nutrients in the mixed layer.\nOnce nutrients are depleted, they can be replaced only by mixing events, such as storms, that replace some of the nutrient-depleted surface water with nutrient-rich deep water.\n\nConcurrently, some near-surface water is moved deeper, below the mixed layer.\nDiatoms and other phytoplankton cells in that water are then typically lost into deep water, where they are unable to photosynthesize and eventually die or are eaten.\n\nThe net effect of a mixing event, then, is a partial loss of the diatom population (namely, those cells in the mixed layer water that is lost to deep water) and, simultaneously, a partial replenishment of nutrients in the mixed mixed layer that can support new growth (contained in the formerly nutrient-rich deep water now part of the mixed layer).","type":"content","url":"/mixedlayers","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🛼 Understanding the

invertebrate larvae always decreases in population due to mortality.\nThis is because there is no mechanism for adding new larvae to the cohort.\nAssuming there is always a non-zero amount of mortality, the larval population must decrease.\n\nThe term competence is used by Larval Biologists to refer to a larva that has developed to a stage and size that makes them capable of metamorphosisis.\nThe term \n\nlarval duration refers to the time required for larvae to reach competence.\nThe ultimate \n\nrecruitment – that is, the fraction of larvae surviving to  successfully metamorphose and join the post-larval population – is then determined by the impacts of the larval mortality rate, acting over the larval duration.\n\nRecently, it has become clear that the larvae of a number of marine invertebrates can \n\nclone, either intrinsically or in response to environmental cues such as chemical stressors or predators.\nIn a cloning species, one larva can divide into two or more genetically identical “daughter” larvae.\nThis means that, in cloning larvae, the number of larvae in a cohort can either increase or decrease at any given time during development.\n\nWhile cloning produces two larvae out of one, it does not provide any additional tissue or nutritional resources to those larvae.\nThis means a larva that clones produces two daughter larvae which are smaller.\nIn most cases it is not known what the metabolic losses of cloning are, as the daughter larvae divide resources from the original larva.\nIf cloning itself is not too metabolically costly, then a reasonable baseline approximation is that the resources of two daughters produced by cloning add up approximately to the resources of the original larva.\n\nWhile cloning has an obvious benefit in terms of larval numbers, it also has costs.\nThose costs may include disruptions to key larval functions such as swimming or feeding, as a clone redevelops a complete larval morphology.\nFor example, if either or both clones are initially formed without a functional stomach, feeding is impossible until one is developed.\nSmaller larvae may experience higher mortality rates, e.g., due to predation (though lower mortality rates are also possible).\nMany  larvae also feed and grow in proportion to their body mass.\nThis means two small larvae feed and grow less than a single large one with equal total body mass.\n\nOther costs may stem from delays to metamorphosis.\nClones likely have a longer larval duration than the original larva, because they are smaller and may have disrupted development.\nDuring this extended larval duration, larvae face predators, pathogens, transport away from favorable habitats, and other risks.\n\nBecause there are relatively few quantitative observations of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae, especially under natural conditions, there is currently little empirical evidence whether or not cloning has important demographic effects on marine invertebrate populations, and if so whether the benefits of cloning outweigh the costs.\n\nSome larvae may also shed parts of their bodies, which are not subsequently capable of developing into adults.

That is, if growth takes approximately a week to develop, the mortality rate is per week, etc.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/larvalcloningmodel#meaningful-parameter-choices","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Modeling the demographic implications of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae","lvl2":"Modes of cloning"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/larvalcloningmodel#modes-of-cloning","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Modeling the demographic implications of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae","lvl2":"Modes of cloning"},"content":"To simulate the Echinoid mode of cloning, set:\n\nf_2=1\n\ns_1<s_2\n\n0 \\le c_0 < 1\n\nTo simulate the Ophiuroid mode of cloning:\n\nf_2<1\n\ns_1>s_2\n\nc_0 = 1\n\n","type":"content","url":"/larvalcloningmodel#modes-of-cloning","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Modeling the demographic implications of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae","lvl2":"Understanding model output"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/larvalcloningmodel#understanding-model-output","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"🧮 Modeling the demographic implications of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae","lvl2":"Understanding model output"},"content":"The output of this graphical interface for the clone_modelND model comprises three plots.\n\nThe plot at the left is a heat map of size distribution of larvae, p(s,t), over larval size (s) and time (t). A vertical line represents the size distribution at one point in simulated time. A horizontal line represents the abundance of larvae of a given size across time.\n\nThe plot at the upper right shows the cumulative number of metamorphs, F(t), across time. The cumulative number of metamorphs at the end of the simulation is given just above the end of this line.\n\nThe plot at the lower right shows the total number of developing larvae of all sizes, P(t), across time.
